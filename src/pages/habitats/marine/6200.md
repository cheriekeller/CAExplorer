## General Information

Seagrasses are marine flowering plants adapted to grow and reproduce in the underwater environment. Florida estuaries and nearshore coastal waters contain the nationâ€™s largest seagrass resources (more than two-million acres), as well as its two most extensive, contiguous seagrass beds (i.e., Florida Bay and the Big Bend region). Factors that affect the establishment and growth of seagrass include light availability, water temperature, salinity, sediment composition, nutrient levels, wave energy, and tidal range. 

Seagrass most often occurs in areas of low to moderate current velocities where the water is clear; thereby allowing sunlight to penetrate to the leaf blades. 

Seagrass communities are highly productive, faunally rich, and ecologically important systems. Hundreds to thousands of species of flora and fauna may inhabit seagrass habitats utilizing food, substrate, and shelter provided by the plants. Seagrasses also stabilize sediments and help maintain water clarity.

## Impacts of Climate Change

Changes in sea level, salinity, temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and ultra violet (UV) radiation can affect seagrass.  Sea level rise reduces the amount of light reaching seagrass beds, thereby reducing growth rates.  Some grass beds may not persist due to shoreline construction and armoring impeding their shoreward migration. Increased water temperature may lead to shifts in range and extent of seagrass species, as species in North Florida are replaced by more tropical species.  

Increased salinity due to decreased freshwater input and increased evaporation rates can cause physiological stress to the vegetation.  

Large-scale die-offs of seagrass in Florida Bay have been attributed to hypoxia and sulfide production driven by warm, hypersaline waters.  Increased water temperature and nutrient enrichment together promote hypoxia and harmful algal blooms.   Increased precipitation will lead to increased runoff, impacting water quality by increasing nutrients, pollutants, and turbidity.

### Impacts to Species

Florida's seagrass beds are vital for providing foraging, refugia and nursery habitat for numerous fish, shellfish, manatees and sea turtles.  Changes in water quality and clarity that impact the health, distribution, and abundance of seagrass beds will impact the health, reproductive success and survival of a multitude of species.  

Degradation or loss of seagrass beds will impact reproductive success, recruitment and survival of many species that depend on it as nursery habitat.  The sea squirt and mollusks attach larvae and eggs to the seagrass leaves, while other juvenile fish and invertebrates use the seagrass beds as refugia, concealing themselves from predators.  

The loss of seagrass beds will further exacerbate degraded water quality due to the loss of the substrate stabilizing function seagrass provides.  Areas devoid of seagrass are vulnerable to intense wave action from currents and storms.
