# How to Use This Tool

## Species Profiles

There are 139 individual species profiles included in this tool. Species are included if they meet at least one of the following criteria:

- Federally listed
- State listed
- Species with a State Species Action Plan
- Specie with a State Management Plan
- Species included in the State Imperiled Species Management Plan
- Species with Habitat Models
- Selected additional species with a Vulnerability Assessment score

Each species profile will include information on life history, range, habitat use, climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation strategies. A map interface will include potential habitat and impacts from sea level rise.

Physical environmental parameters play a major direct or indirect role in determining species distribution, survival and ecosystem sustainability. Many species of fish and wildlife in Florida have limited ranges that are determined in part by climatic conditions and their survival could be threatened by future climatic shifts. This threat is greater for species with narrower tolerance ranges and species occupying habitats in areas where migration or relocation is challenging due to physical barriers. Limited movement/migration pathways include natural (e.g., rivers) and man-made (e.g., roads, land use) barriers. Species with a limited ability to disperse or having specialized habitat requirements, small populations or low genetic diversity are expected to be most at risk.

Floridaâ€™s species have migrated and adapted to climate change in the past, but that ability is severely compromised now due largely to human modification of the landscape. Up to 76% of 236 surveyed species were deemed unlikely to be able to relocate inland in response to rising sea levels. Nearly one quarter of the approximately 1,200 species tracked by the Florida Natural Areas Inventory are projected to have at least 50% of their range lost to a sea level rise of 1 m. Several keystone species are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and the loss of these species can have cascading impacts on natural communities and other species.

Species will be impacted by changes in temperature, precipitation, extreme events, sea level rise, and carbon dioxide concentration.

## Priority Resource and Habitat Profiles

**TODO**

## Adaptation Strategies

The examples of adaptation strategies provided for each priority resource, habitat and species are not meant to be comprehensive, but examples of potential adaptation strategies. Specific site conditions and the expertise of land managers should be used in strategy development and selection. The provided strategies should be viewed as a starting point to help in the development of a comprehensive adaptation strategy.

Each species has example adaptation strategies provided on their species profile page. [See all species](/species).

Adaptation strategies for priority resources and habitats can be accessed from the associated profile pages. [See all priority resources and habitats](/habitats).

There are many general adaptation strategies that address impacts across all ecosystems and habitats. Examples of these are presented as cross-cutting adaptation strategies. Additionally, examples of general strategies for addressing existing non-climate stressors are presented here. The majority of these strategies came directly from the National Fish Wildlife and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy.
