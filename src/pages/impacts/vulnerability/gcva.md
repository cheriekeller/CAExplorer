# Gulf Coast Vulnerability Assessment

The Gulf Coast Vulnerability Assessment (GCVA) evaluated species and habitats near the Gulf coast using the Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment (SIVVA).

**This analysis includes 4 habitats and 11 species.**

## Methods

The Gulf Coast Vulnerability Assessment included six ecoregions across the Gulf coast. Three of these overlap with Florida:

- Coastal Florida Coastal Plain (CFCP)
- South Florida Coastal Plain (SFCP)
- Southern Coastal Plain (SCP).

Species were selected that have a distribution throughout the Gulf and include those that would be representative of other species. Habitats were selected based on data availability and models.

Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment (SIVVA) and SIVVA-Natural Communities methods were used to evaluate the vulnerability of species and ecosystems.
