# Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment (SIVVA) - Natural Communities

This vulnerability assessment is a spreadsheet-based vulnerability assessment tool that uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative criteria that can be adapted to fit the nature of the vulnerability assessment.

**This tool includes 30 natural communities assessed using this framework.**
