# Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment (SIVVA)

This vulnerability assessment is a spreadsheet based vulnerability assessment tool for both species and natural communities. It uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative criteria that can be adapted to fit the nature of the vulnerability assessment.

**This tool includes 83 of the 300 species of conservation concern and 30 natural communities assessed using this framework.**
