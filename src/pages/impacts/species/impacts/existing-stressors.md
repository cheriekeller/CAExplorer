# Interaction with Existing Non-climate Stressors

Climate change will compound many of the existing stressors and threats to species and habitats and lead to an increased rate of biodiversity loss.

Three key drivers of biodiversity loss include existing threats, direct effects of climate change, and the interaction between the existing threats and climate change. The ability of species and systems to adapt to climate change will be further challenged when considering the effects of these other stressors.

The overall vulnerability of some ecosystems may be primarily driven by the severity of these non-climate stressors and the degree to which they interact with climate change. The synergistic effects of climate and non-climate stressors, leading to range reductions and population declines, may be severe enough to threaten some species with extinction or extirpation from significant portions of their ranges.

### Existing threats expected to have synergistic effects with climate change include:

- Habitat loss
- Fragmentation and degradation
- Invasive species
- Pathogens, pests/parasites, and pollutants
- Competition for resources and overexploitation

**TODO: Examples of ways to address these stressors can be found here.**

## Synergistic Effect of Climate Change and Non-climate Stressors

### Impacts of climate change may be exacerbated by existing stressors:

- Pollution may increase sensitivity of corals to temperature and bleaching
- Destruction of riparian vegetation may increase stream exposure to higher temperatures/ erosion
- Habitat fragmentation may limit adaptive capacity
- People's response to climate change may cause additional stressors

### Climate change may exacerbate existing stressors:

- Heavier downpours may lead to more polluted runoff
- Warming may allow movement of nonnative species and diseases

Climate change may not (yet) matter for species already on brink of extinction due to existing stressors.

## Habitat Loss, Fragmentation, and Degradation

Habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are the most pervasive threats to biodiversity with human caused habitat fragmentation the greatest threat to species. Habitat loss has been identified as the most significant challenge Florida’s biodiversity has faced over the past century. These threats are expected to continue as human populations are predicted to continue to increase and lead to additional land use changes.

Fragmented habitats and human land uses will hinder movement of species, further reducing their ability to shift their distributions in response to climate change. The ability of plant and animal species to retreat in response to rising waters (both sea level rise and flood events) will be affected by barriers preventing their retreat, including human-made structures, such as buildings, bulkheads, roadways, and other obstructions. Additionally, manmade ecosystem alterations, either those already existing or those put in place in response to effects from climate change, may lead to increased habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. For example, the use of hardened shoreline stabilization measures coupled with more intense storms could lead barrier islands (and their habitats) to fragment and disappear.

The effects of roads as barriers altering natural hydrology will be exacerbated by changes in the amount of precipitation and large storm events. If precipitation patterns shift to fewer rainfall events but with larger amounts of rainfall, existing transportation infrastructure, such as bridges and culverts, may not be sufficient to accommodate the increased flow.

## Invasive Species

Florida has a well-documented list of invasive plants and animals—a list that is expected to increase as temperatures warm, number of frost/freeze nights decrease, intensity and/or frequency of storm events increase, and Florida’s human population increases and responds to climate change. More than 170 species of ferns and flowering plants are naturalized in southeastern Florida and hundreds of exotic plants have been introduced into the region. Some of these species are not currently invasive or have not spread beyond South Florida; however, with climate change, these species may become invasive in the future or expand their current range into other regions of the state. Category I plants, defined as invasive exotics that are altering native plant communities by displacing native species, changing community structures or ecological functions, or hybridizing with natives include species such as Melaleuca, Australian Pine, Water-hyacinth, and old world climbing fern. These species are invading native habitats and decreasing diversity, in some cases becoming so abundant that they interfere with species use of the area (e.g., nesting sea turtles and crocodiles) and contribute to the degradation of the habitat (e.g., erosion, clogging water bodies).

There are more than 400 documented non-native animals in Florida, although not all are currently considered invasive. The Gambian pouch rat, Burmese python, green iguana, giant toad, walking catfish, Cuban tree frog, and lionfish are examples of invasive animals found in Florida. These species are known to prey upon and compete with native species. The Burmese python, native to Asia, is now found throughout much of southern Florida and has been the focus of several recent studies on impacts to native species. Many of the invasive plant and animal species found in Florida are constrained to their current extent by temperature. As temperatures increase and the number of frost/freeze nights is reduced or eliminated, many of these species will be able to migrate northward, expanding their range and potentially increasing the density of their infestations/populations.

Invasive species can have significant impacts on fundamental biological processes and these will most likely increase as climate change affects the distribution, spread, abundance, and impact of the invasive species. Climate change is expected to exacerbate impacts from non-native invasive species by facilitating the introduction of invasive species and by increasing the invasiveness (rate of spread, competitiveness) of species. Invasive species affect native populations via competition, predation, and disease, as well as by alterations of habitat structure and the food web dynamics, such as replacing natives that serve as a food source (e.g., plants providing fruits, seeds, nectar, pollen).

Climate change has already enabled range expansion of some invasive species and will likely create welcoming conditions for new invaders. Climate changes, including extreme climatic events (i.e., storms, floods), can enhance invasion processes from initial introduction through establishment and spread. Changes in the amount and timing of precipitation can alter the pathways of species introductions as new or increased flow routes transport invasive species, including animals, plants and plant propagules. Changes in precipitation may also allow for additional areas to be invaded by existing species, such as the Brazilian pepper.

The competitive resistance of native species may be reduced as climate change causes native species to shift out of the conditions to which they are adapted. It is expected that, on average, mechanisms (e.g., dispersal) enabling invasion will allow existing invasive species to expand their ranges into newly suitable habitat more quickly than native species. Therefore, those species that have the ability to shift ranges quickly would have a competitive advantage if native populations become progressively poorer competitors for resources in a changing climate. In addition to facilitating the colonization of new invasive species, climate change could exacerbate the effects of existing invasive species, including selective mortality of native versus invasive species, reversals in competitive dominance, increased consumption by predators, or increased virulence of disease organisms.

How species respond to the impacts of climate change may make it necessary to re-evaluate the definitions of “non-native” and “invasive” species. Some species not currently considered native, but instead transient or occasional, may “naturally” expand or shift their range more permanently into Florida. For example, there is speculation that climate change is a contributing factor in the natural invasion and recent establishment in Florida of two species of tropical dragonflies from Cuba and the Bahamas. Climate change could also facilitate the movement of native species into a new area of habitat or increase its abundance in an area, and in doing so it may harm other native species in ways we typically associate with invasive species, possibly leading to localized mass extinctions, speciation, and the formation of new ecosystems. Climate change impacts on the population size and scarcity of native species will influence the significance of the impact from invasive species.

## Pathogens, Pests/Parasites, and Pollutants

Climate change may result in increasing pathogen development and survival rates, disease transmission, and host susceptibility. Warmer temperatures allow disease organisms to complete their life cycle more rapidly and attain higher population densities. Additionally, native diseases that currently only have minor effects on host organisms could have more devastating impacts under future climatic conditions. Many marine and terrestrial species’ pathogens are sensitive to shifts in temperature, rainfall, and humidity. As temperatures increase, many diseases are expected to become more lethal and to spread more readily. There are climate-linked predictions that amphibians will decline in unusually warm years due the influence of temperature on disease dynamics.

Increased temperatures impact parasites by increasing their growth rates, sexual maturation, and number of generations per year. Higher temperatures can also promote earlier maturation, transmission, and potential maintenance of transmission year-round. Warmer temperatures allow pests/parasites to complete their life cycle more rapidly, and in some cases doubling the number of generations per year, and attain higher population densities.

Alterations to temperature, pH, dilution rates, salinity, and other environmental conditions due to climate change can affect the impacts of pollutants on species and systems. The effects from these climatic changes can modify the availability of pollutants, the exposure and sensitivity of species to pollutants, transport patterns, and the uptake and toxicity of pollutants. Increased coastal flooding and inundation may result in release of contaminants from coastal soils, sediments, and infrastructure and increase exposure of fish, wildlife, and plants to these pollutants. The amount of runoff of phosphorus and other nutrients from farms and other landscapes currently contributes to harmful algal blooms and is expected to worsen with predicted increases in floods and other extreme precipitation events.

## Competition for Resources and Overexploitation

Florida’s natural systems, in addition to their role in supporting biodiversity, provide a multitude of public services—supporting working landscapes, commercial and recreational activities. When well-maintained and well-managed, Florida’s ecosystems can support these activities; however, overexploitation, misuse, and illegal activities can cause harm to the systems, communities, and species. Climate change can heighten species’ vulnerability to overexploitation and, inversely, exploitation has made species particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. Species and populations impacted by climate change may be more vulnerable to over-harvesting if they become easier to harvest due to altered and increased movements as they react to loss or degradation of habitat, if they are forced to find alternative food sources, if their behavior is altered, or if they become stressed or diseased.

Increases to ground and surface water withdrawal to accommodate current and increased human populations as well as potential shifts in land use could further degrade systems that are stressed by decreased precipitation and droughts. Extraction of fresh water can significantly alter natural water flows, leading to impacts on habitats and the populations and species dependent upon them. Reduced precipitation will act in concert with water extractive activities, leading to decreases in water availability and flows causing potential alterations in food/prey abundance and availability, misalignment of reproductive cycles of aquatic organisms, increased rates of disease/parasite transmission as species are crowded into fewer remaining suitable areas, and direct loss of habitat. Increased water demands for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use along with rising temperatures will lower water tables, severely impacting wetlands.
