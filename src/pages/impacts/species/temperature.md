# Impacts to Species from Changes in Temperature

Changes in temperature can lead to various impacts on species, depending on the season and duration of the temperature change.

### Impacts from increased average summer temperatures include:

- Species range reductions or shifts due to reduced habitats
- Reduction of threatened species due to temperature increases exacerbating existing stressors
- Shift in fish communities from sportfish to rough fish
- Changes in community composition
- Skewed sex ratio of species with temperature-dependent sex determination
- Altered length of spawning season for fish
- Altered food web dynamics
- Increased prevalence of disease and parasites
- Altered composition of parasite community
- Increased fish kills due to less dissolved oxygen
- Increased mortality
- Earlier physiological developments and larval release in plankton
- Range expansion of invasive exotic species

### Impacts from increased minimum winter temperatures (warmer lows) include:

- Increased pathogen and vector survival and disease transmission rates
- Local extirpations of species at the southern extent of their range
- Increased growth rates of fish (potentially beneficial change)
- Earlier onset of spawning by fish species whose spawning is initiated by a minimum temperature
- Loss of Alosine (shad) due to mortality and reduced reproductive success
- Range expansion of euryhaline marine species further into inland waters

### Impacts from increased temperature extremes (colder lows) include:

- Reduced fitness, recruitment, and competitive ability
- Increased mortality
- Shift in species distribution
- Reduced reproductive success due to delayed timing of reproduction
- Decoupling of predator/prey relationships of fish
- Impediments to seasonal movement due to variation in temperature regimes
- Increased mortality for cold temperature sensitive species
- Increased occurrence and severity of cold kill events
- Limit northern extent/expansion of exotic species range (potentially beneficial change)
