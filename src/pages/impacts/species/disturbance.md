# Altered Disturbance Regimes

Many species and their associated habitats are dependent upon disturbance regimes to initiate life cycle phases (e.g., seed release, germination, breeding). Florida has many species that only thrive in fire maintained systems. Other disturbance regimes, if altered, could be detrimental to species and habitats, including increased severity and frequency of storm events, flooding, droughts, and wildfire.

### Impacts include:

- Altered fire regimes
- Decreased frost frequency
- Increased frequency duration, and/or severity of droughts
- Increased frequency, duration, and/or severity of floods
- Increased severity and/or duration of storm events
