# Impacts to Species from Changes in Water Chemistry

**TODO: intro paragraph**

### Impacts from freshwater chemistry changes include:

- Increased stress
- Increased mortality
- Increased disease, pathogens, parasites
- Reduced reproductive success
- Decreased physiological functions (shell formation)

### Impacts from ocean acidification include:

- Increased mortality (events) in corals and shell-forming organisms
- Decreased metabolic rate
- Depressed immune responses
- Decline in primary productivity
- Decreased growth due to reallocation of resources to maintain calcification
