# Florida's Species

Florida has more than 16,000 species of native fish, wildlife, and invertebrates, including 147 endemic vertebrate species and approximately 400 terrestrial and freshwater endemic invertebrates. There are currently 82 species designated as federally endangered or threatened in Florida. An additional 59 species are listed as endangered or threatened by the state, including 21 birds, eight mammals, 13 reptiles, four amphibians, nine fish, and four invertebrates.

This tool includes species profile for 139 species. These species were chosen based on:

- Federally listed
- State listed
- Species with a State Species Action Plan
- Specie with a State Management Plan
- Species included in the State Imperiled Species Management Plan
- Species with Habitat Models
- Selected additional species with a Vulnerability Assessment score

## Vulnerability of Species to Climate Change

Many generalist species, such as white-tailed deer or raccoons, are likely to continue to thrive in a changing climate. Species, both native and exotic, with traits that assist in invading or colonizing disturbed areas (e.g., ability to change/adjust their range, phenology, and physiology) will have an advantage in a rapidly changing climate.

In contrast, the most vulnerable species generally have:

- poor dispersal ability
- long generation times
- long time to sexual maturity
- low reproductive rates
- low genetic variability
- narrow environmental tolerances
- specialized requirements or relationships with other species
- specialized habitat and/or microhabitat requirements
- narrow geographic range
- dependence on specific triggers or cues likely to be disrupted by climate change
