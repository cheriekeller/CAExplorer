# Florida's Species

Florida has more than 16,000 species of native fish, wildlife, and invertebrates, including 147 endemic vertebrate species and approximately 400 terrestrial and freshwater endemic invertebrates. There are currently 82 species designated as federally endangered or threatened in Florida. An additional 59 species are listed as endangered or threatened by the state, including 21 birds, eight mammals, 13 reptiles, four amphibians, nine fish, and four invertebrates.

Climate change impacts on species will be driven by one or multiple climate-related factors acting in concert or synergistically.

This tool includes species profile for 139 species.

## Impacts to Florida Species

Climate change impacts on species will be driven by one or multiple climate-related factors acting in concert or synergistically.

### Impacts of climate change on species include:

- [altered community dynamics](/impacts/species/impacts/altered-dynamics)
- [altered habitat suitability/geographic range](/impacts/species/impacts/altered-range)
- [altered species fitness and survival](/impacts/species/impacts/altered-survival)
- [altered phenology and physiology](/impacts/species/impacts/altered-phenology)
- [increased risk of extinction](/impacts/species/impacts/altered-survival)

Additionally, climate climatic shifts that lead to altered disturbance regimes will have direct and indirect impacts on species. Species that will likely be most vulnerable to climate change are those that have:

- poor dispersal ability
- long generation times
- long time to sexual maturity
- low reproductive rates
- low genetic variability
- narrow environmental tolerances
- specialized requirements or relationships with other species
- specialized habitat and/or microhabitat requirements
- narrow geographic range
- dependence on specific triggers or cues likely to be disrupted by climate change

Many generalist species, such as white-tailed deer or raccoons, are likely to continue to thrive in a changing climate. Species, both native and exotic, with traits that assist in invading or colonizing disturbed areas (e.g., ability to change/adjust their range, phenology, and physiology) will have an advantage in a rapidly changing climate.

The biodiversity and ecology of Florida are already suffering from a number of existing stressors, including:

- habitat loss
- fragmentation and degradation
- invasive plants and animals
- altered hydrologic regimes
- overexploitation
- pathogens, parasites and pollutants.

Loss of habitat is the most significant threat to Floridaâ€™s species. The effects on species and habitat from existing stressors will likely be exacerbated by climate change. The impacts of climate change will also be compounded by existing stressors.
