# Florida's Species

Florida has more than 16,000 species of native fish, wildlife, and invertebrates, including 147 endemic vertebrate species and approximately 400 terrestrial and freshwater endemic invertebrates. There are currently 82 species designated as federally endangered or threatened in Florida. An additional 59 species are listed as endangered or threatened by the state, including 21 birds, eight mammals, 13 reptiles, four amphibians, nine fish, and four invertebrates.

- Federally listed
- State listed
- Species with a State Species Action Plan
- Specie with a State Management Plan
- Species included in the State Imperiled Species Management Plan
- Species with Habitat Models
- Selected additional species with a Vulnerability Assessment score -->

## Climatic Influence on Species

Physical environmental parameters play a major direct or indirect role in determining species distribution, survival and ecosystem sustainability. Many species of fish and wildlife in Florida have limited ranges that are determined in part by climatic conditions and their survival could be threatened by future climatic shifts. Florida’s species have migrated and adapted to climate change in the past, but that ability is severely compromised now due largely to human modification of the landscape.

## Level of Impact

Many generalist species, such as white-tailed deer or raccoons, are likely to continue to thrive in a changing climate. Species, both native and exotic, with traits that assist in invading or colonizing disturbed areas (e.g., ability to change/adjust their range, phenology, and physiology) will have an advantage in a rapidly changing climate.
Climate change impacts on species will be driven by one or multiple climate-related factors acting in concert or synergistically.

Species that are likely to be most affected by climate change have:

- poor dispersal ability
- long generation times
- long time to sexual maturity
- low reproductive rates
- low genetic variability
- narrow environmental tolerances
- specialized requirements or relationships with other species
- specialized habitat and/or microhabitat requirements
- narrow geographic range
- dependence on specific triggers or cues likely to be disrupted by climate change

## Species Movement and Migration

Climate change impacts may be more severe for species occupying habitats in areas where migration or relocation is challenging due to physical barriers. Barriers to movement/migration pathways can be caused by natural (e.g., rivers) and man-made (e.g., roads, land use) features.

Migratory species may be impacted at multiple geographic scales, experiencing alterations of habitat in their wintering grounds, breeding grounds, and/or along their migratory pathway. Mechanisms that aid in migrations, such as wind and water currents, may have positive or negative consequences depending on whether changes increase or decrease required energy expenditures to complete their migration. Altered directions of winds/currents can impact species’ ability to navigate to the desired location, even delivering individuals to the wrong location.

Although migratory species are adapted to adjust their behavior with annual changes in the weather, shifts in climatic variables are beginning to result in mistimed migration, with some species abandoning migration altogether and others shifting their migratory pattern. Changes in cues (e.g., temperatures, precipitation) for migration initiation or pathways could lead to mismatched availability of resources required for successful completion of migration or reproductive success and survival upon arriving at the spring or winter destinations.
