# Impacts of Climate Change in Florida

Each major change to the earth’s climate is associated with a range of possible local, measurable climate shifts. In the coming century, projections indicate that few other states will be impacted by climate change as severely as Florida.

## Overall Impacts

The distribution and amount of Florida’s species and habitats may be very different in the future, with some species and ecosystems affected to a greater extent than others. Climate change will have impacts on Florida’s natural resources that operate at the individual, population, community, and ecosystem scales. These impacts will affect species through changes in community dynamics, habitat suitability and geographic range, species fitness and survival, phenology and physiology, risk of extinction, and altered disturbance regimes. Community-level impacts will occur as plant and animal species move and adapt at different rates, leading to changes in structure and composition. Many of these changes are based upon impacts to the systems, including sea level rise, changes in precipitation, changes in air temperature, changes in extreme events and increased carbon dioxide concentration and interactions with existing stressors.

The overall vulnerability of some systems and species is primarily driven by the severity and extent of existing non-climate stressors, including human-caused alterations and impacts. The rate of climate change may become the most important feature in terms of consequences for biodiversity, potentially leading to escalating extinctions and widespread reorganizations of ecosystems, particularly where the rate of change is too fast and overwhelms the capacity of current ecosystems to adapt. Those species, populations, and communities that cannot keep pace with the rate of change will be most adversely impacted. Phenology, or the timing of life history events, is likely to change in response to climate shifts, both as the climate becomes warmer but also as it becomes more variable. Changes in species phenology may lead to major disruptions to co-evolutionary relationships, such as those between pollinators and the plants they pollinate.

Climate change will have additional impacts on Florida’s natural resources that will affect social, cultural and economic aspects of Florida’s natural resources including the ability of residents and tourist to safely enjoy and use them.

### Major impacts include:

- Many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances, and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change (**high confidence**).
- A large fraction of both terrestrial and freshwater species faces increased extinction risk under projected climate change during and beyond the 21st century, especially as climate change interacts with other stressors, such as habitat modification, over-exploitation, pollution, and invasive species (**high confidence**).

* Within this century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) pose high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure, and function of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands (**medium confidence**).
* Due to sea level rise projected throughout the 21st century and beyond, coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts such as submergence, coastal flooding, and coastal erosion (**very high confidence**).
* Due to projected climate change by the mid 21st century and beyond, global marine-species redistribution and marine-biodiversity reduction in sensitive regions will challenge the sustained provision of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem services (**high confidence**).
* For medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5, 6.0, and 8.5), ocean acidification poses substantial risks to marine ecosystems, especially polar ecosystems and coral reefs, associated with impacts on the physiology, behavior, and population dynamics of individual species from phytoplankton to animals (**medium to high confidence**).

## Social and Cultural Impacts of Climate Change in Florida

Florida is well-known for its variety of outdoor activities, enjoyed by both residents and tourists. Changes in precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and an increased intensity of storms may cause a reduction in activities such as birdwatching, wildlife viewing, hunting, fishing, and other recreational opportunities. Such opportunities may be affected due to changes in the species presence, abundance, diversity and health, alterations to the species habitats, compromised habitat due to storm damages and flooding, and restricted access to waterways.

Florida may lose key elements of its floral and faunal diversity, including endemic species, many of which are the focus of wildlife viewing activities.

Reduced availability and opportunity could have a significant impact on Floridian's who depend on local fish, wildlife and plants for subsistence and traditional uses.

The availability of healthy and safe resources such as clean ground and surface water, and a disease-free environment may be impacted by climate change. In the future, there may be increased competition for limited freshwater resources between humans and wildlife. This limitation could be caused by and/or contribute to a reduction in healthy ground surface water supplies. Changes in precipitation and storm events (e.g., floods) could increase the number and severity of contaminated wellfields.

There may be some positive consequences to climate related changes. Precipitation changes may provide increased opportunities for waterfowl hunting, improved sportfish populations, and improved angler harvest.

## Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Florida

As with addressing other threats to Florida’s species and habitats, there will be costs associated with minimizing and/or adapting to climate change impacts. There could be increased costs to various management activities including, land management, invasive plant and animal control, and mosquito control. Altered fire regimes could lead to increased costs for management activities such as fire suppression, and smoke management. Control of invasive plant species that are able to better adapt to changing climate conditions could have significant budgetary impacts for agencies and private landowners.

Climate change impacts could lead to increased numbers of insects due to increased number of life cycles/year, increased suitable breeding conditions and sites, and/or population declines of predators (e.g., frogs), leading to an increased need to manage nuisance insects (e.g., mosquitos). Additionally, there will be costs associated with monitoring and reacting to changes in the abundance and diversity of parasites and disease vectors that may impact emergence and virility of diseases to animals and humans.

Commercially important areas and activities may experience decreased stocks of harvested fish, crabs, shrimp, clams and oysters. Climate change may impact species directly through changes in their growth, reproduction or survival or indirectly through impacts to important nursery grounds and reef habitats. The number, size, and health of harvestable species will directly affect individuals who depend on a healthy fishery for their livelihood. Warmer winter temperatures could better enable pests to overwinter, leading to impacts on forest health and harvest yield.
