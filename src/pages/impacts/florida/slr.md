One of the most direct and pronounced changes due to global climatic change is sea level rise (SLR). Easily modeled and quantified at multiple scales, SLR is commonly used as a landscape level example of climate change. Inundation by increasing sea levels will have variable impacts on ecosystems, depending on various factors including elevation, species composition (salt tolerance), inland migration pathways, and extent.

While SLR is not technically a climatic change itself (rather a result of major climatic changes), it is associated with specific measurable shifts that result in ecological impacts in much the same way as the other climatic changes described. It is too simplistic to treat SLR as purely a habitat loss or inundation, as some land cover types may expand or shift up inland in the face of SLR. Some habitat and community shifts are likely to occur, especially with a more modest rise in sea levels. However, as the rate of SLR increases, open water will become more prominent as other habitats diminish.

Sea level rise is often modeled in defined increments such as feet or meters. This tool includes an analysis of impacts of SLR at 1 and 3 meters.

Sea level rise will not impact the coastal areas of Florida to the same degree. Multiple variables will influence the type of changes and impacts, including location, coastline complexity, elevation, habitat type, and the presence of barriers to inland migration.

Barriers to inland migration include anthropogenic structures such as seawalls, dikes, and coastal development, as well as natural biophysical factors such as different soils or available groundwater. These barriers may make it difficult or impossible for species and habitats to migrate inland with increasing sea levels.

## Impacts to Ecosystems

Impacts caused by changes in water and soil salinity will vary based on ecosystem type; Coastal, Terrestrial, and Freshwater, and Estuarine/Marine.

When considering the impact of SLR, there will likely be a shift in the natural community structure before being completely lost. With loss of habitat, the impact to species will vary but in some cases will be extreme.
