The following tools may be useful in evaluating climate change, climate impacts, vulnerability of species and ecosystems, and informing climate-smart management practices.

</div>

This tool simulates various SLR scenarios and the corresponding areas that would be impacted by flooding. Additional information about marsh impacts, nuisance flood frequency and social and economic data is also provided.

</div>

This report from the NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) and the Nature Conservancy provides a basic understanding of the parameters and uncertainties involved in modeling the future impacts of sea level rise on coastal wetlands.

##[The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM)](http://warrenpinnacle.com/prof/SLAMM/)

<div class="float-left thumbnail-small">
<img src="tools-slamm.jpg"></img>
</div>

This model simulates the dominant processes involved in wetland conversions and shoreline modifications during long-term SLR. It relies on digital elevation data to simulate the long-term impact of seal level rise (SLR) on tidal zones. Map distributions of wetlands are predicted under conditions of accelerated sea level rise, and results are summarized in tabular and graphical form. Model developed by Warren Pinnacle Consulting, Inc.
