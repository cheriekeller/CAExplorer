# Impacts to Ecosystems and Habitats from Changes to Extreme Events

Changes in extreme events can lead to various impacts, depending on the type, timing, frequency, severity and duration of the extreme event. Extreme events can include storms such as severe thunderstorms, tornados, and hurricanes, as well as extreme temperature events such as prolonged heat waves and freeze events.

See extreme event-related impacts for:

- [Coastal Ecosystems](#Coastal)
- [Terrestrial Ecosystems](#Terrestrial)
- [Freshwater Ecosystems](#Freshwater)
- [Estuarine and Marine Ecosystems](#Marine)

## Coastal Ecosystems

### Impacts from increased intensity / frequency of storms:

- Increased accretion/sedimentation and erosion due to stronger storms
- Increased structural damage to coastal systems due to increased storm intensity
- Degradation of low lying marshes and barrier islands due to coastal erosion
- Increased salinity of coastal wetlands and surficial groundwater
- Increased breaches of coastal areas leading to alterations in storm buffering
- Increased mortality
- Reduced fitness of species
- Increased exposure to invasive species and parasites

### Impacts from increased floods:

- Loss of barrier islands
- Habitat degradation
- Loss of habitat integrity
- Changes in patterns of sediment transport
- Altered physical conditions of habitat
- Habitat fragmentation

### Impacts from increased droughts:

- Reduced effectiveness of dune stabilizing plants
- Increased erosion
- Altered patterns sediment build-up
- Loss of sediment due to decreased runoff driven sedimentation rates

<hr id="Terrestrial"></hr>

## Terrestrial Ecosystems

### Impacts from increased intensity / frequency of storms:

- Altered habitat type/composition of forested riparian communities due wind damage
- Increased mortality
- Reduced fitness of species
- Increased exposure to invasive species and parasites
- Disruption of life cycle events
- Increased accumulation of heavy metals and other pollution
- Wind damage â€“ loss of habitat

### Impacts from increased floods:

- Increased tree/plant mortality due to higher water levels
- Shift in dominant tree/plant species due to species-specific flood induced mortality

### Impacts from increased droughts:

- Changes in community composition
- Increased prevalence of invasive species
- Increase in wildfires
- Reduced opportunities for prescribed fire
- Increased pest outbreaks
- Loss of ephemeral ponds and wetlands
- Increased drought related diseases in forest trees

<hr id="Freshwater"></hr>

## Freshwater Ecosystems

### Impacts from increased intensity / frequency of storms:

- Altered habitat type/composition of wetland communities due wind damage
- Increased erosion, sediment transport and runoff into freshwater systems
- Increased spread of exotic or invasive species
- Increased levels of particulate and dissolved substances (nitrates, ammonia)
- Altered water chemistry due to increased runoff
- Increased mortality due to increased pollution entering the aquatic systems
- Increased stream flow
- Increased high water levels due to increased precipitation from storms
- Altered water quality due to changes in nutrient and sediment
- Increased extent of freshwater habitats due to increased precipitation from storms (potentially beneficial change)

### Impacts from increased floods:

- Increased connectivity of ephemeral wetlands to adjacent wetlands and water bodies
- Increased woody debris carried in stream channels
- Increased flow of pollutants from surrounding watersheds into streams, rivers, ponds and lakes
- Displacement of stored organic carbon as floods cause scouring of the streambed
- Increased turbidity and sedimentation from runoff

### Impacts from increased droughts:

- Changes in stream temperature
- Changes in debris loads due to alterations in riparian vegetation
- Decreases in the oxygen-holding capacity of surface water
- Increased anoxia and chemical transformation in surface waters
- Alterations in the transport of organic matter or sediments into freshwater systems
- Increased heavy metals and other toxic substance concentrations Decreased bacterial, fungal and microbial activity due to reduced detritus decomposition
- Increased protozoa and bacteria levels in warm water
- Increased habitat fragmentation due to changes in spatial distribution and extent of habitat
- Increased invasive nonnative plant species in lakes and wetlands
- Reduced spring flow
- Increased mortality of riparian trees and other vegetation
- Loss of connectivity between freshwater systems
- Decreased stream flow or drying up of streams in areas downstream of springs

## Estuarine and Marine Ecosystems

### Impacts from increased intensity / frequency of storms:

- Alteration of longshore transport process
- Increased sedimentation and turbidity (decreased light penetration)
- Decreased stability of systems
- Direct physical damage
- Increased runoff into coastal waters with increased storm intensity
- Disruption of the interspecies dynamics due to varying spatial and temporal changes

### Impacts from increased floods:

- Altered sediment build-up patterns in coastal marshes and estuaries
- Habitat degradation at various temporal and spatial scales
- Loss of habitat integrity due to issues such as sediment transport

### Impacts from increased droughts:

- Changes in habitat distribution
- Increased erosion due to reduced effectiveness of dune stabilizing plants
- Altered salinity levels and seasonal salinity profiles
- Increased of pollutants in runoff due to lack of regular flushing of build-up
- Reduction in habitat quality and area (volume)
