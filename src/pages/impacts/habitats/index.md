# Ecosystems and Habitats

Florida is in a transitional zone where the pine and bottomland hardwood elements of the Coastal Plain begin to merge with the tropical elements of south Florida. Florida supports over 80 unique habitats including the scrub habitats of the Lake Wales Ridge, the Big Cypress Swamp, the coral reefs and tropical hardwood hammocks of the Florida Keys, mangroves, interior dry prairie, cypress domes and the Everglades. Florida has abundant surface water in lakes, rivers, streams, marshes and springs. The underlying karst geology supports more first magnitude springs (33) than any other state. Florida has 10,000 miles of rivers and streams and 7,800 lakes.

Florida’s landscape is one of the most rapidly changing and climate-vulnerable within the United States. It is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise and impacts from severe storms due to low elevation, geographic location and configuration. Many of the unique subtropical ecosystems are very sensitive to temperature and precipitation fluctuations.

This tool includes four ecosystems, split into nine priority resources, highlighting 39 habitats.

The local physical geography (e.g., elevation, soil type, hydrology, climate) largely determines the type and extent of the natural communities in Florida. Florida’s elevation range is extremely small, ranging from sea level to a high of approximately 107 meters. However, the subtle changes in elevation; in combination with variations in the physical geography; have led to an incredible range of ecosystems within the state.

The Florida Everglades has received international recognition and has long been recognized as one of our nation’s most imperiled landscapes. The Everglades is home to 68 threatened and endangered species. Many of Florida’s rarest and most diverse communities occur as small isolated areas, such as pine rocklands, rockland hammocks, upland glades, seepage slopes, cutthroat seeps and springs. The mild tropical-maritime climate of the Florida Keys provides habitats for a number of terrestrial and marine plant and animal species found nowhere else. Florida has an extremely diverse estuarine and marine ecosystem; it is the only state in the continental U.S. with an extensive shallow reef system.
Coastal areas provide critical habitat for many of Florida’s threatened species, including seaside sparrows, beach mice, sea turtles, beach nesting birds, and many endemic plant species.

Florida’s ecosystems and habitats will be impacted by the major climatic shifts Florida is likely to experience including sea level rise, changes in precipitation, changes in air temperature, changes in extreme events, and changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration.

### Major Ecosystems in Florida:

Priority Resources were identified by the Peninsular Florida Landscape Conservation Cooperative (PFLCC) as the set of biological, ecological, and cultural features most important for Florida’s Landscape. The priority resources represent the most significant resources, embody key landscape components, and reflect the mission, vision, common interests, and values of the PFLCC partners.

### PFLCC Priority Resources:

- High Pine and Scrub (3 habitats)
- Pine Flatwoods and Dry Prairie (5 habitats)
- Hardwood Forested Uplands (1 habitats)
- Working Lands (2 habitats)
- Coastal Uplands (7 habitats)
- Freshwater Forested Wetlands (5 habitats)
- Freshwater Non-forested Wetlands (6 habitats)
- Freshwater Aquatic (4 habitats)
- Estuarine/Marine (6 habitats)
