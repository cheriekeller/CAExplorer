# Ecosystems and Habitats

Florida’s unique landscape is one of the most rapidly changing and climate-vulnerable within the United States. It is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise and impacts from severe storms due to low elevation, geographic location, and landscape configuration. Many habitats and species are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation.

Florida’s ecosystems and habitats will be impacted by the major climatic shifts Florida is likely to experience including sea level rise, changes in precipitation, changes in air temperature, changes in extreme events, and changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration.

The state supports over 80 unique habitats including the scrub habitats of the Lake Wales Ridge, the Big Cypress Swamp, the coral reefs and tropical hardwood hammocks of the Florida Keys, mangroves, interior dry prairie, cypress domes and the Everglades. Many of Florida’s rarest and most diverse communities occur as small isolated areas, such as pine rocklands, rockland hammocks, upland glades, seepage slopes, cutthroat seeps and springs.

## Florida has Many Unique Habitats

Florida is in a transitional zone between the pine and bottomland hardwood elements of the Coastal Plain and the tropical elements of south Florida. The location of natural communities is influenced by the local physical geography, including elevation, soil type, hydrology, climate. Florida’s elevation range is extremely small, ranging from sea level to a high of approximately 107 meters above mean sea level. However, subtle changes in elevation in combination with variations in physical geography have led to an incredible range of habitats within the state. Many of these unique habitats are very sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation.

For example, one of the most imperiled landscapes in the nation - the Florida Everglades - has received international recognition and is home to 68 threatened and endangered species. Likewise, the Florida Keys, with a mild tropical-maritime climate, provides habitats for a number of terrestrial and marine plant and animal species found nowhere else.

Florida has abundant surface water in lakes, rivers, streams, marshes and springs. The underlying karst geology supports more first magnitude springs (33) than any other state. Florida has 10,000 miles of rivers and streams and 7,800 lakes.

Florida also has an extremely diverse marine and estuarine ecosystem, and is the only state in the continental U.S. with an extensive shallow reef system. Vulnerable coastal areas provide critical habitat for many of Florida’s threatened species, including seaside sparrows, beach mice, sea turtles, beach nesting birds, and many endemic plant species.

### Landscape Conservation Planning - Conservation Assets:

Conservation Assets (formerly known as Priority Resources) were identified by the Peninsular Florida Landscape Conservation Cooperative (PFLCC) as the set of biological, ecological, and cultural features most important for Florida’s Landscape. They represent the most significant resources, embody key landscape components, and reflect the mission, vision, common interests, and values of the PFLCC partners.

Conservation assets include:

- High Pine and Scrub
- Pine Flatwoods and Dry Prairie
- Hardwood Forested Uplands
- Coastal Uplands
- Freshwater Forested Wetlands
- Freshwater Non-forested Wetlands
- Rivers and Streams
- Lakes, Ponds, and Reservoirs
- Springs
- Mangrove Swamp
- Saltwater Marsh
- Seagrass
- Coral Reef / Hardbottom
- Marine / Estuarine System (inlets, bays, open ocean)
- Working Lands
