# Habitat Loss, Fragmentation, and Degradation

Strategies for habitat loss and related impacts can include:

- Provide landowners with appropriate incentives for conservation and restoration of key habitats, such as conservation easement tax incentive programs, designed to protect private lands of high habitat connectivity value under climate change.
- Work with water resource managers to enhance design and siting criteria for water resources infrastructure to reduce impacts and restore connectivity in floodplains and aquatic habitats.
- Consider application of offsite habitat banking linked to climate change habitat priorities as a tool to compensate for unavoidable onsite impacts and to promote habitat conservation or restoration in desirable locations.
- Minimize impacts from alternative energy development by focusing siting options on already disturbed or degraded areas.
- Identify options for redesign and removal of existing structures or barriers where there is the greatest potential to restore natural processes.
- Work with farmers and ranchers to develop and implement livestock management practices to reduce and reverse habitat degradation and to protect regeneration of vegetation.
