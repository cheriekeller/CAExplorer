# Competition for Resources and Overexploitation

Strategies for competition and overexploitation can include:

- Reduce ground and surface water withdrawals in areas experiencing drought and/or increased evapotranspiration.
- Promote water conservation, reduce water use, and promote increased water quality via proper waste disposal.
- Reduce negative impacts of capture practices and gear on important habitats for fish, wildlife, and plants.
- Determine sustainable harvest levels in changing climate, and design, implement, and evaluate management plans and practices to eliminate over-harvest of fish, wildlife, and plants.
- Increase efforts to monitor and reduce illegal species trade in the United States.
