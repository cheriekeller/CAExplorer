### Strategies for education and outreach can include:

- Develop training on the use of existing and emerging tools for managing under uncertainty (e.g., vulnerability and risk assessments, scenario planning, decision support tools, and adaptive management).
- Develop training materials to help managers and decision makers apply climate knowledge to the administration of existing natural resource and environmental laws and policies.
- Encourage use of interagency personnel agreements and interagency (state, federal, and tribal) joint training programs as a way to disperse knowledge, share experience and develop interagency communities of practice about climate change adaptation.
- Use public access points, nature centers, and hunting and fishing regulation guides to inform tourists, visitors, and recreational users of climate change impacts to and adaptation strategies for fish, wildlife, and plants.
- Make research and monitoring information regarding climate impacts to species and natural systems accessible and easily understood to the public and other partners.
- Develop, implement, and strengthen existing communication efforts between federal agencies, with states and tribes to increase awareness of the impacts and responses to climate change.
- Develop focused outreach efforts and materials aimed at local, state, tribal, and federal government authorities; land and water managers; economic policy decision makers; zoning and transportation officials; etc. on ecosystem services, climate impacts to fish, wildlife, plants, and ecosystems, the impacts of other local stressors, and the importance of adaptation planning.
