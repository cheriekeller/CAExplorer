# Invasive Species

Strategies for invasive species can include:

- Use, integrate, and implement existing risk assessment methodologies for imported organisms and establish appropriate regulations to prevent deliberate importations of species that are predicted to be harmful or invasive.
- Employ a multiple barriers approach to detect and contain incoming and established invasive species, including monitoring at points of origin and points of entry for shipments of goods and materials into Florida.
- Apply risk assessment and scenario planning to identify actions and prioritize responses to invasive species that pose the greatest threats to natural ecosystems.
