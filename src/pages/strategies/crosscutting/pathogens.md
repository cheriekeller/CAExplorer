# Pathogens, Pests / Parasites, Pollutants

Strategies for pathogens, pests / parasites, pollutants can include:

- Use, integrate, and implement existing pest and pathogen risk assessment methodologies for imported organisms and establish appropriate regulations to prevent deliberate importations of pests and pathogens.
- Work with federal, state, regional, and county agricultural interests to identify potentially conflicting needs and opportunities to minimize ecosystem degradation resulting from pest and pathogen eradication, suppression, and control efforts.
- Reduce existing pollution and contaminants and increase monitoring of air and water pollution as necessary.
- Work with water resource managers to identify, upgrade, or remove outdated sewer and stormwater infrastructure to reduce water contamination.
- Increase restoration, enhancement, and conservation of riparian zones and buffers in agricultural and urban areas to minimize non-point source pollution.
