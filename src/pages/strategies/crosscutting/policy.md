### Strategies for policy can include:

- Provide landowners and stakeholder groups with incentives for conservation and restoration of key corridor habitats through conservation programs.
- Review and revise existing habitat impact avoidance, minimization, mitigation, and compensation standards and develop new standards as necessary to address impacts in a manner that incorporates climate change considerations.
- Review existing legal, regulatory and policy frameworks and identify opportunities to develop or enhance market-based incentives to support restoration of habitats and ecosystem services impacted by climate change.
- Encourage flexible policies that take into account changing climate conditions (e.g., grazing on conservation lands, harvest of certain plants).
- Create a moratorium on developing in undisturbed areas of endemic habitats, focusing development in previously developed and/or abandoned areas.
