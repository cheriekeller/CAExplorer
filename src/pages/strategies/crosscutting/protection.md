# Land and Water Protection

Strategies for protection can include:

- Conserve areas representing the range of geophysical settings, including various bedrock geology, soils, topography, and projected climate, in order to maximize future biodiversity.
- Build back-up redundancy into the network of conservation areas by protecting multiple examples of the range of priority areas.
- Assess and take steps to reduce risks of facilitating movement of undesirable non-native species, pests, and pathogens.
