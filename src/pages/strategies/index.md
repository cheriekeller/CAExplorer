# Adaptation Strategies

The impacts of climate change will be felt across a multitude of systems in the human and natural world. Using an adaptation approach is vital in the face of these growing climate pressures. Simply conserving species or habitats where they exist under present conditions may not be sufficient

Climate Change Adaptation is the adoption and implementation of goals and strategies designed to prepare for and adjust to current and future climatic changes, and the associated impacts on natural systems and human communities

Biodiversity conservation in a changing climate requires a re-evaluation of management goals and objectives. Management approaches will need to be forward-looking and focus on maintaining a diversity of well-functioning ecosystems, as it could be very difficult to maintain the current spatial arrangements and composition of systems, communities, and species under a changing climate.

Adaptation planning is a process that assesses the future change of current conditions, and adjusts management techniques and goals as needed to support positive outcomes. Adaptation strategies are those that better enable management to plan for and react to climate change impacts, the effects of which will serve to exacerbate anthropogenic related stresses to natural communities.

Strategies should target processes that encourage ecosystem resilience, reduce external stressors and safeguard genetic diversity. Developing adaptation strategies for natural systems requires an understanding of how climate change may affect important species and habitats, as well as how effects may interact with other ongoing threats, ecological processes, and management actions.

It is important to note that adaptation does not replace current conservation practices and standards, but expands the applicability of these tools to better address the realities of a changing world.

### Key Concepts

#### Resistance

The ability of a system to remain essentially intact or unchanged as climate changes.

#### Resilience

The ability of a system to recover from or adjust easily to a disturbance, returning to its original state. In the emerging context of climate change, resilience might best be measured more in terms of overall ecosystem structure, function, and process rates and less in terms of taxonomic composition.

#### Transformation

The change in a system’s composition and/or function in response to changes in climate or other factors.

## Common Elements of Adaptation Strategies:

- Create special protections (for: keystone species, corridors, processes, habitats)
- Reduce anthropogenic stresses (e.g., pollution, development, overharvest)
- Ensure genetic diversity (species or ecosystems)
- Restore altered ecosystems to original function
- Create or maintain refugia
- Relocate species
- Anticipate and prepare for shifting wildlife movement patterns
- Maintain key ecosystems services
- Monitor and plan to support adaptive management goals
- Ensure legislative and regulatory flexibility to climate change
- Increase awareness and knowledge of stakeholders
- Promote sustainable use of resources (subsistence, recreational, and commercial)

These can be used as a starting point develop more specific adaptation strategies.

## Adaptation Strategy Guidance

These eight advisory statements will aid you in the development of adaptation strategies. These general statements are more practical rules of thumb to remember when defining strategies. They can be applied to a wide variety of situations, habitats and species.

1. Actions need to be implemented at a range of management levels.

2. Actions should rely on sound planning that promotes the investment of resources in reliable strategies.

3. Actions need to be focused on achieving clearly defined objectives and integrated with other policies and other natural resource management plans that have been developed. Implementation activities developed to overcome climate change impacts need to be coordinated with existing policy objectives and planning processes for conservation of fish and wildlife species.

4. Planning and management for natural resource management activities need to be flexible, adaptive, and creative.
5. A risk management approach should be incorporated into adaptation planning. Risk management processes will help reduce the probability that negative impacts may occur, while being prepared to manage the consequences should those impacts take place.

6. Actions should maximize conservation for priority fish and wildlife species. Emphasize conservation in areas where a) fish and wildlife species are under immediate threat from climate change impacts, and b) the activities undertaken will significantly improve adaptation for vulnerable species.

7. Management activities should increase ecosystem resilience to better address the uncertainty associated with projected climate change impacts.

8. Management strategies should account for critical thresholds of species and ecosystems. For all species and ecosystems there is a need to understand the points at which climatic (e.g., temperature or CO2 concentration) and ecological (e.g., population density or mortality rate) thresholds exist, beyond which significant, sometimes irreversible, changes may occur.

## Cross-cutting Adaptation Strategies

#### Protection:

- Conserve areas representing the range of geophysical settings, including various bedrock geology, soils, topography, and projected climate, in order to maximize future biodiversity.
- Build back-up redundancy into the network of conservation areas by protecting multiple examples of the range of priority areas.
- Assess and take steps to reduce risks of facilitating movement of undesirable non-native species, pests, and pathogens.

#### Restoration:

- Develop and implement restoration protocols and techniques that promote ecosystem resilience and facilitate adaptation under a range of possible future conditions.
- Restore or enhance areas that will provide essential habitat and ecosystem services during ecosystem transitions under a changing climate.
- Restore disturbance regimes as appropriate to emerging conditions, including instituting human-assisted disturbance where necessary (e.g., prescribed fire).
- Develop programs to encourage resilience through restoration of habitat features that provide natural buffers.
- Redesign or mitigate existing physical barriers or structures that impede movement and dispersal within and among habitats to increase natural ecosystem resilience to climate change.
- Consider climate change in post-fire or post-drought restoration/enhancement – emphasize use of plant species that will be robust to climate change.
- Anticipate increased need for seed sources and propagated plants.
- Maintain a seed inventory with high-quality seed for a range of species, particularly species that may do well in the future under hotter conditions.

#### Planning:

- Identify and map high priority areas for conservation using information such as species distributions (current and projected), habitat classification, land cover, and geophysical settings (including areas of rapid change and slow change).
- Identify and prioritize areas currently experiencing rapid climate impacts (e.g., coastal areas).
- Assess and prioritize critical connectivity gaps and needs across current conservation areas, including areas likely to serve as refugia in a changing climate.
- Incorporate climate change considerations into new and future revisions of species and area management plans using the best available science regarding projected climate changes and trends, vulnerability and risk assessments, scenario planning, and other appropriate tools as necessary.
- Identify species and habitats particularly vulnerable to transition under climate change (e.g., wetlands, cool-water to warm-water fisheries, or cool season to warm season grasslands) and develop management strategies and approaches for adaptation.
- Develop strategic protection, retreat, and abandonment plans for areas currently experiencing rapid climate change impacts.
- Increase planning phase of restoration activities to buffer against years with unfavorable conditions.
- Include invasive species prevention strategies in all plans/projects.

#### Research:

- Bring managers and scientists together at the appropriate scales to prioritize research needs that address resource management objectives considering a changing climate.
- Prioritize research on questions relevant to managers of near-term risk environments.
- Identify and address priority climate change knowledge gaps and needs (e.g., species adaptive capacity, risk and rewards of assisted relocation, climate change synergy with existing stressors).
- Develop and use models of climate impacted physical and biological variables and ecological processes at temporal and spatial scales relevant for conservation.
- Increase scientific and management capacity to develop management strategies to address climate change impacts.
- Collect seeds from and monitor the species most vulnerable to climate change.

#### Policy:

- Provide landowners and stakeholder groups with incentives for conservation and restoration of key corridor habitats through conservation programs.
- Review and revise existing habitat impact avoidance, minimization, mitigation, and compensation standards and develop new standards as necessary to address impacts in a manner that incorporates climate change considerations.
- Review existing legal, regulatory and policy frameworks and identify opportunities to develop or enhance market-based incentives to support restoration of habitats and ecosystem services impacted by climate change.
- Encourage flexible policies that take into account changing climate conditions (e.g., grazing on conservation lands, harvest of certain plants).
- Create a moratorium on developing in undisturbed areas of endemic habitats, focusing development in previously developed and/or abandoned areas.

#### Education/Outreach:

- Develop training on the use of existing and emerging tools for managing under uncertainty (e.g., vulnerability and risk assessments, scenario planning, decision support tools, and adaptive management).
- Develop training materials to help managers and decision makers apply climate knowledge to the administration of existing natural resource and environmental laws and policies.
- Encourage use of interagency personnel agreements and interagency (state, federal, and tribal) joint training programs as a way to disperse knowledge, share experience and develop interagency communities of practice about climate change adaptation.
- Use public access points, nature centers, and hunting and fishing regulation guides to inform tourists, visitors, and recreational users of climate change impacts to and adaptation strategies for fish, wildlife, and plants.
- Make research and monitoring information regarding climate impacts to species and natural systems accessible and easily understood to the public and other partners.
- Develop, implement, and strengthen existing communication efforts between federal agencies, with states and tribes to increase awareness of the impacts and responses to climate change.
- Develop focused outreach efforts and materials aimed at local, state, tribal, and federal government authorities; land and water managers; economic policy decision makers; zoning and transportation officials; etc. on ecosystem services, climate impacts to fish, wildlife, plants, and ecosystems, the impacts of other local stressors, and the importance of adaptation planning.

#### Collaboration:

- Identify and partner with key stakeholder groups (e.g., conservation and environmental organizations, hunting and angling groups, trade associations, outdoor manufacturers and retailers) to help develop and distribute key climate change and adaptation messages tailored for their interest groups as well as the broader public.
- Work with partners at landscape scales to strengthen and maximize use of existing conservation programs to conserve private lands of high conservation value, to enhance habitat values and maintain working landscapes under climate change.
- Integrate agency and state climate change adaptation programs with other regional conservation efforts to foster collaboration.
- Establish a program to monitor changes in the timing of plant blooms and pollinator arrival.

#### Monitoring:

- Use available long-term monitoring programs at appropriate scales as baselines for system changes that could be affected by climate change.
- Develop, refine, and implement monitoring protocols that provide key information needed for managing and conserving species and ecosystems in a changing climate.
- Use existing or define new indicators at appropriate scales that can be used to monitor the response of fish, wildlife, plants, and ecosystems to climate change.
- Develop specific programs and/or modify existing programs (e.g., bird and amphibian surveys) to motivate action and engage citizens in monitoring impacts of climate change on the landscape (e.g., citizen science monitoring for detection of invasive species).
- Monitor and evaluate areas successfully regenerate after disturbances and promote these areas to serve a future potential refugia.
- Monitor species and habitats long-term to identify response to climate change.

## Adaptation Strategies for Existing Stressors

#### Habitat Loss, Fragmentation and Degradation:

- Provide landowners with appropriate incentives for conservation and restoration of key habitats, such as conservation easement tax incentive programs, designed to protect private lands of high habitat connectivity value under climate change.
- Work with water resource managers to enhance design and siting criteria for water resources infrastructure to reduce impacts and restore connectivity in floodplains and aquatic habitats.
- Consider application of offsite habitat banking linked to climate change habitat priorities as a tool to compensate for unavoidable onsite impacts and to promote habitat conservation or restoration in desirable locations.
- Minimize impacts from alternative energy development by focusing siting options on already disturbed or degraded areas.
- Identify options for redesign and removal of existing structures or barriers where there is the greatest potential to restore natural processes.
- Work with farmers and ranchers to develop and implement livestock management practices to reduce and reverse habitat degradation and to protect regeneration of vegetation.

#### Invasive Species:

- Use, integrate, and implement existing risk assessment methodologies for imported organisms and establish appropriate regulations to prevent deliberate importations of species that are predicted to be harmful or invasive.
- Employ a multiple barriers approach to detect and contain incoming and established invasive species, including monitoring at points of origin and points of entry for shipments of goods and materials into Florida.
- Apply risk assessment and scenario planning to identify actions and prioritize responses to invasive species that pose the greatest threats to natural ecosystems.

#### Pathogens, Pests/Parasites and Pollutants:

- Use, integrate, and implement existing pest and pathogen risk assessment methodologies for imported organisms and establish appropriate regulations to prevent deliberate importations of pests and pathogens.
- Work with federal, state, regional, and county agricultural interests to identify potentially conflicting needs and opportunities to minimize ecosystem degradation resulting from pest and pathogen eradication, suppression, and control efforts.
- Reduce existing pollution and contaminants and increase monitoring of air and water pollution as necessary.
- Work with water resource managers to identify, upgrade, or remove outdated sewer and stormwater infrastructure to reduce water contamination.
