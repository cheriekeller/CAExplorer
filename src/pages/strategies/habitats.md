See the [habitats page](/habitats) to find your priority resource or habitat of interest. The adaptation strategies for that priority resource or habitat are available from its profile page.

These adaptation strategies are not meant to be comprehensive, but are a starting point to help in the development of more comprehensive adaptation strategies that include knowledge of site-specific factors and the expertise of land managers.

You can also learn more about [cross-cutting adaptation strategies](/strategies/crosscutting) that are more generally applicable across species and habitats.
