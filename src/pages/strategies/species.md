See the [species page](/species) to find your species of interest. The adaptation strategies for that species are available from its profile page.

These adaptation strategies are not meant to be comprehensive, but are a starting point to help in the development of more comprehensive adaptation strategies that include knowledge of site-specific factors and the expertise of land managers.

You can also learn more about [cross-cutting adaptation strategies](/strategies/crosscutting) that are more generally applicable across species and habitats.
