# Amphibians

Florida is home to approximately 54 native amphibians, including 2 federally listed and 2 state listed species. Florida’s humid tropical and subtropical climate makes an ideal home for many frogs, salamanders and newts. Unfortunately, these optimal habitat characteristics also support a large number of introduced species.

Florida’s amphibians are especially susceptible to the hydrological shifts expected with climate change. Salination from sea level rise, increased periods of drought and increased severe storm events are likely to alter the delicate chemistry of the freshwater systems on which these creatures depend. Increased fire suppression in a climate where controlled burns become more difficult to implement is likely to magnify these threats.
