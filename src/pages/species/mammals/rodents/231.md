# Sherman’s short-tailed shrew
### *Blarina shermani*



**Conservation status:** State Threatened

**TODO:vulnerability**

With a body length of about 4 inches, Sherman’s short-tailed shrew is larger than other species in Florida.  This rodent has a small range limited to Collier and Lee counties in southwest Florida.  Short-tailed shrews eat a diet of ants, beetle larvae and butterflies and typically have two annual breeding seasons, both between March and November.

    
## Habitat Requirements

Sherman’s short-tailed shrews prefer dense herbaceous habits with a floor of damp soil and debris.  Swamps, hydric hammocks and pinelands are common habitat types for this species.

## Climate Impacts

Sherman’s short-tailed shrews are susceptible to sea level rise in their coastal range.  Additionally, this species faces many of the same existing threats common to coastal species: habitat loss and degradation from development, barriers to migration, habitat disturbance from recreational use and high mortality from non-native predators.

## Adaptation Strategies

- Conservation of existing habitat will allow this shrew the best chance of recovering and maintaining a healthy population as climate change begins to accelerate.  This includes controlling existing stressors, such as reducing populations of non-native predators.
