# St. Andrew beach mouse
### *Peromyscus polionotus peninsularis*



**Conservation status:** Federally Endangered

**TODO:vulnerability**

Very little is known about the life history of the St. Andrew beach mouse, a subspecies of the small old-field mouse, endemic to a small range from the dunes of St. Joseph Peninsula in Gulf County, Florida to near St. Andrew Bay in Bay County, Florida.  The beach mouse can reach a length of 5 inches.  The St. Andrew beach mouse is dependent on dune habitat for food and shelter, burrowing under dune vegetation and eating a diet of insects, seeds and fruit.   The species is monogamous and has the fast-reproductive cycle common of small mammals.  Breeding season typically occurs during the early winter months but can continue year-round in optimal food and climate conditions.

    
## Habitat Requirements

The St. Andrew beach mouse relies exclusively on sand dune habitat on the Gulf coast of the Florida panhandle.

## Climate Impacts

As a coastal endemic subspecies, the St. Andrew beach mouse faces substantial threats related to climate change.  First, sea level rise is a grave impending threat to the beach mouseâ€™s island habitat.  Additionally, this species faces many of the same existing threats common to coastal or island species: habitat loss and degradation from coastal development, barriers to migration, habitat disturbance from recreational use and high mortality from non-native predators.  These existing threats are likely to be magnified by the increasingly severe storm events and shifting conditions of a changing climate.

## Adaptation Strategies

- Conservation of existing beach habitat will allow the beach mouse the best chance of recovering and maintaining a healthy population as climate change begins to accelerate.  This includes controlling existing stressors, such as reducing populations of non-native predators.

- As sea level rise may eventually become too great a threat for the St. Andrew beach mouse in its current habitat, developing and maintaining a captive breeding population is a strategy to consider for this coastal endemic subspecies.
