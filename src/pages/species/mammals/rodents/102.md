**Conservation status:** Federally Endangered

**TODO:vulnerability**

Relatively little is known about the Anastasia Island beach mouse, a subspecies of the small old-field mouse, now endemic only to Anastasia Island, Florida.  The mouse’s current geographic range is only a portion of its historic – this subspecies once extended north through Mickler’s Landing in St. Johns County.  The beach mouse can reach a length of 5 inches and has a pale colored back ranging from yellow-brown to grey-pink with a white tail and belly.  The Anastasia Island beach mouse is dependent on dune habitat for food and shelter, burrowing under dune vegetation and eating a diet of insects, seeds and fruit.   The species is monogamous and has the fast-reproductive cycle common of small mammals.  Breeding season typically occurs during the early winter months but can continue year-round in optimal food and climate conditions.

    
## Habitat Requirements

The Anastasia Island beach mouse relies exclusively on sand dune habitat vegetated by sea oats and dune panic grass.

## Climate Impacts

As an endangered sub-species endemic to an island, the Anastasia Island beach mouse faces substantial threats related to climate change.  First, sea level rise is a grave impending threat to the beach mouse’s island habitat.  Additionally, this species faces many of the same existing threats common to coastal or island species: habitat loss and degradation from coastal development, barriers to migration, habitat disturbance from recreational use and high mortality from non-native predators.  These existing threats are likely to be magnified by the increasingly severe storm events and shifting conditions of a changing climate.

## Adaptation Strategies

- Conservation of existing beach habitat will allow the Anastasia Island beach mouse the best chance of recovering and maintaining a healthy population as climate change begins to accelerate.  This includes controlling existing stressors, such as reducing populations of non-native predators.

- As sea level rise may eventually become too great a threat for the Anastasia Island beach mouse in its current habitat, developing and maintaining a captive breeding population is a strategy to consider for this island endemic subspecies.
