## General Information

This midsized rodent can reach a body length of up to 16 inches.  Key Largo woodrats have brown-black backs with reddish undertones on the sides and short tails relative to their body size.  Endemic to Key Largo, Florida, this woodrat forages for a diet of mushrooms, berries, seeds and leaves and builds stick nests at the base of trees or stumps.  Key Largo woodrats nest throughout the year with a peak season in the winter.

## Habitat Requirements

The Key Largo woodrat inhabits tropical hardwood hammock habitats within its small geographic range.

## Climate Impacts

The Key Largo woodrat is highly susceptible to sea level rise.  Additionally, this species faces many of the same existing threats common to coastal or island species: habitat loss and degradation from coastal development, barriers to migration, habitat disturbance from recreational use and high mortality from non-native predators.  Competition with black rats is also a serious current threat to this species with the potential to worsen under climate change.

## Vulnerability Assessment(s)

The overall vulnerability level (High to Very High) was based on the following assessment(s).

<div class="vulnerability-header">
<h3><a href="/impacts/vulnerability/sivva/species">Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment</a></h3>
<div class="vulnerability vulnerability-extreme">Extremely vulnerable</div>
</div> 

The primary factors contributing to vulnerability of the Key Largo woodrat are sea level rise, presence of barriers, habitat fragmentation, changes in salinity, and runoff and storm surge

## Adaptation Strategies

- Conservation of existing habitat will allow the Key Largo woodrat the best chance of recovering and maintaining a healthy population as climate change begins to accelerate.  This includes controlling existing stressors, such as reducing populations of non-native predators.

- As sea level rise may eventually become too great a threat for the Key Largo woodrat in its current habitat, developing and maintaining a captive breeding population is a strategy to consider for this endemic subspecies.
