**Conservation status:** Federally Endangered

**TODO:vulnerability**

While the Florida panther’s historic range once extended from Florida to Louisiana and throughout the Gulf states, today the large cat occupies only 5 percent of that range.  A population of approximately 120-230 adult panthers is now limited primarily to southern Florida, south of the Caloosahatchee River.  Florida panthers are the larger of Florida’s two native cat species (panthers and bobcats.  The panther’s prey base consists of small and large mammals, reptiles, and birds.  Kittens remain with their mother for up to two years in the wild, hunting alongside of her before venturing off on their own.

    
## Habitat Requirements

Panthers utilize a variety of habitat types including hardwood forests, prairies and swamps.  These solitary and territorial creatures are habitat generalists partly due to their need for ample space.  Males require approximately 200 square miles, while females require about 75 square miles.

## Climate Impacts

Florida panther habitat is concentrated inland so does not tend to be directly impacted by sea level rise.  However, habitat fragmentation and encroachment by humans are two of the biggest driving forces in reducing the panther population from historical to current levels.  Roadside mortality is currently the leading cause of panther death in the wild.  As coastal inundation from sea level rise occurs, resulting increases in human development within panther habitat could greatly exacerbate current stressors.  Changes in climate and subsequent development patterns could also further compromise the feasibility of critical prescribed fire management in panther habitat.

## Adaptation Strategies

- Preserving large, connected patches of suitable habitat allowing panthers to move freely to find the most suitable habitat in a changing landscape is the most important adaptation strategy for the Florida panther.

- Monitoring and maintaining healthy panther populations throughout the cat’s current range to bolster resilience is an important first step in adapting to a changing climate.
