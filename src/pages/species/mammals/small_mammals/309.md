# Everglades mink
### *Neovison vison evergladensis*



**Conservation status:** State Threatened

**TODO:vulnerability**

This midsized weasel has silky dark brown fur with white spots on the chin and chest.  The Everglades mink is a distinct subspecies of the American mink endemic to south Florida near the Everglades and Big Cypress.  This mink eats a diet of small mammals, snakes and insects.  Everglades minks breed along with the fall rainy season, averaging a litter of about four young per year.

    
## Habitat Requirements

This mink inhabits shallow Everglades marshes within its narrow range.

## Climate Impacts

Everglades mink habitat is highly susceptible to sea level rise.  Additionally, this species faces many of the same existing threats common to coastal species in south Florida: habitat loss and degradation from coastal development, barriers to migration, habitat disturbance from recreational use and high mortality from non-native predators, especially Burmese pythons.

## Adaptation Strategies

- Conservation of existing habitat will allow the Everglades mink the best chance of recovering and maintaining a healthy population as climate change begins to accelerate.  This includes controlling existing stressors, such as reducing populations of non-native predators.

- As sea level rise may eventually become too great a threat for the Everglades mink in its current habitat, developing and maintaining a captive breeding population is a strategy to consider for this endemic subspecies.
