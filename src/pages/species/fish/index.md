Approximately 1,177 native fishes swim in Floridaâ€™s waterways, including 5 federally listed and 7 state listed species. Fish comprise an essential part of freshwater, estuarine and marine ecosystems in the state and form the backbone of critical commercial and recreational fisheries.

Freshwater fish are highly vulnerable to changes in water chemistry and quality linked to climate change including warming temperatures, lower dissolved oxygen and increased turbidity and contaminants. Both freshwater and estuarine fish are highly vulnerable to changes in salinity from saltwater intrusion as sea level rise accelerates. Marine fishes are also vulnerable to changing water chemistry as the ocean warms, including acidification and increased incidents of harmful algae.
