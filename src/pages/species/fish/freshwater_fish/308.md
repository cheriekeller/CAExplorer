## General Information

These large, light brown darters are an isolated population in Florida. Crystal darters occur only in the Escambia River watershed in Florida but outside of the state they can be found throughout the Mississippi basin.  Darters are benthic fish, named for their tendency to move between spots in short bursts of motion.  In between “darts” of movement they remain very still.  Darters lack a swim bladder, allowing them to control their buoyancy.  Crystal darters rely on a diet of a variety of invertebrates.

## Habitat Requirements



Crystal darters inhabit rivers with moderate flow and a sandy or gravel floor.  This species is highly sensitive to water quality and flow levels within its range.

## Climate Impacts

The crystal darter occupies a small geographic range in Florida, making it particularly vulnerable to changes in its surrounding habitat including insolated disturbance events. This darter is sensitive to water quality in its habitat, leaving it vulnerable to increased sedimentation and pollution and changes in temperature, water chemistry and flow levels linked to climate change.  As many species begin to shift their ranges in response to climate change, crystal darters may be threatened by the increased presence of invasive species or hybridization with other species of darters.

## Vulnerability Assessment(s)

This species was not assessed for vulnerability.

## Adaptation Strategies

- Prioritize key stream systems that are less vulnerable to climate change.   As this species is dependent on high water quality, focusing restoration and conservation efforts on the sites with the with the highest likelihood of resilience in a future climate may be an effective strategy.
