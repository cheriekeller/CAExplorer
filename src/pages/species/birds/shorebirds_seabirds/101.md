# American oystercatcher
### *Haematopus palliates*



**Conservation status:** State Threatened

**TODO:vulnerability**

As its name implies, the American oystercatcher inhabits the coastal areas that support intertidal shellfish, with a wide range throughout Florida, Mexico and the Mid-Atlantic.  This species is one of few shorebirds that feeds primarily on mollusks.  Oystercatchers are equipped with strong bills specialized to loosen the adductor muscle responsible for keeping shells tightly closed.  The American oystercatcherâ€™s bright, red-orange bill is also a key identification feature for the species, in addition to a distinct red eye ring set off by a dark black or brown head and backside.  Nesting season extends from March through August.  Oystercatchers are a predominantly ground-nesting species and chicks are mobile immediately after hatching and flight capable at around 35 days.  However, they remain dependent on adults for food for at least two months.

    
## Habitat Requirements

American oystercatchers prefer beaches, sandbars, salt marsh, oyster reefs and spoil islands and favor sparse vegetation cover.  Florida supports both a resident breeding population of oystercatchers as well as a large wintering population.

## Climate Impacts

American oystercatcher habitat is expected to become significantly inundated from sea level rise.  Although new habitat may also become available as the sea rises and coastal habitat shifts inland, developed areas may create barriers to habitat migration.  Existing stressors from habitat loss due to coastal development and armoring, predators and disturbance coupled with increasing severe weather events due to climate change pose a concern for this species.  Furthermore, the mollusks on which oystercatchers depend for food are particularly sensitive to changes in water quality due driven by climate change.

## Adaptation Strategies

- Develop climate smart practices for beach and coastal management including the use of living shorelines as opposed to hard-armoring for coastal protection wherever possible.  Living shorelines constructed from recycled oyster shells offer a means of creating habitat for oysters and in-turn, oystercatchers.  Oyster reef habitat may be able to naturally increase sediment and provide stabilization for the shoreline at a rate that keeps pace with sea level rise.

- Protect coastal land through fee-simple or easement acquisition of areas serving as natural storm buffers.

- Increase understanding and modeling of expected changes to habitat including expected patterns of inland marsh migration as a tool to prioritize and inform conservation efforts.
