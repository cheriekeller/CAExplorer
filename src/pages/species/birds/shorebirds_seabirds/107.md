### *Rynchops niger*

**Conservation status:** State Threatened

**TODO:vulnerability**

The black skimmer is a seabird with a wide, graceful wingspan that can be easily identified by its large red bill which narrows to a sharp, black tip.  The lower portion of the bill is longer than the top and the bird uses its lower bill by skimming it along the surface of the water to catch fish, for which it is named.  The black skimmer has a wide range throughout Florida and many portions of the Americas.  This species breeds during the summer months between May and September and black skimmers hatch and raise their chicks in large colonies of nests on the sand.

    
## Habitat Requirements

Black skimmers can be found in coastal areas throughout the state including estuaries, beaches and sandbars.  They prefer sparsely vegetated patches of sand as sites for nesting colonies.

## Climate Impacts

As a beach nesting species, the black skimmer is highly vulnerable to many threats that are common in coastal areas including habitat inundation from sea level rise.  An increase in the severity of storm events linked to climate change also poses a threat to black skimmers as hurricanes and strong storms during the summer nesting season can reduce breeding success and population size over time.  Habitat fragmentation stemming from changes in coastal development patterns linked to climate change is also likely to be a concern for this species.

## Adaptation Strategies

- Conservation of existing beach habitat will allow the black skimmer the best chance of increasing and maintaining a healthy population in the state as climate change begins to accelerate.  This includes controlling existing stressors, such as impacts from coastal development and traffic.  As a beach nesting species, non-native predators pose a grave threat to nesting birds and should be controlled to the extent possible.

- Conserving healthy future coastal habitat as sea levels rise and human communities begin to shift is important for this species.
