### *Plestiodon egregius egregius*

**Conservation status:** State Threatened

**TODO:vulnerability**

This small brown skink is native to the Florida Keys as its name implies.  The Florida Keys mole skink is a secretive creature and little is known about its life history or reproduction.  These lizards rely on a diet of small insects and arthropods found within their coastal habitat.  Nesting season occurs in the spring when females lay clutches of 3-5 eggs in underground nests.

    
## Habitat Requirements

The Florida Keys mole skink inhabits sandy shoreline areas throughout on the islands it has colonized, preferring to seek shelter under rocks, sand and tidal debris.

## Climate Impacts

The Florida Keys mole skink is highly vulnerable to sea level rise.  The lizardâ€™s narrow distribution will make it a challenge for the Florida Keys mole skink to adapt to increasingly harsh island conditions.  Sea level rise, coastal erosion and increasingly strong or frequent storm events are likely to be a concern for this species.

## Adaptation Strategies

- Develop climate smart practices for beach and coastal management including the use of living shorelines as opposed to hard-armoring for coastal protection wherever possible.

- Protect coastal land through fee-simple or easement acquisition of areas serving as natural storm buffers.

- Like many species endemic to the Florida Keys, this species is extremely vulnerable to long-term sea level rise. As such, development of a captive breeding program may be a necessary long-term adaptation strategy.
