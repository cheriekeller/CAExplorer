# Impacts to Ecosystems and Habitats from Changes in Precipitation

Changes in precipitation can lead to various alterations to the hydrologic cycle, depending on the timing and amount of rainfall.

See precipitation-related impacts for:

- [Coastal and Terrestrial Ecosystems](#Terrestrial)
- [Freshwater Ecosystems](#Freshwater)
- [Estuarine and Marine Ecosystems](#Marine)

## Coastal and Terrestrial Ecosystems

### Impacts from increased precipitation include:

- Increased above ground biomass (particularly in scrub ecosystems)
- Loss of suitable ground-nesting habitat due to seasonal flooding
- Reduced efficiency of prescribed due to increased soil moisture and increased plant growth
- Increased erosion
- Altered community composition

### Impacts from decreased precipitation include:

- Increased wildfires due to drier conditions
- Increased competitive pressure on native vegetation as density and distribution increases for other native, more drought-tolerant species
- Altered community composition
- Reduced fitness due to stress
- Shifts in range of temperate trees and shrubs as rainfall decreases and temperature increases
- Range expansion of sub-tropical vegetation and range contraction of temperate woody species
- Southern pine forests replaced by pine savannas and grassland due to increased fires and stress
- Decreased efficiency of prescribed fire as opportunities to burn are reduced
- Increased pine mortality due to pine beetle infestations as trees become stressed

### Impacts from changes in timing of precipitation:

- Reduced reproductive success – decreased bloom/fruit/seed production
- Reduced growth/reduced growing season
- Altered grassland plant species composition due to increased rainfall variability

## Freshwater Ecosystems

### Impacts from decreased precipitation include:

- Increased nutrient and sediment loading due to increased runoff
- Reduction in availability/connectivity of spawning areas

### Impacts from decreased precipitation include:

- Reduced average freshwater discharge from Lake Okeechobee
- Reduced littoral zone flushing of tussock and other organic material
- Reduced spawning habitat as connectivity between rivers and floodplain is reduced
- Increased abundance, prevalence and diversity of aquatic parasites
- Increased cyanobacteria blooms and cyanotoxin concentrations in waterbodies
- Decreased connectivity of 1st and 2nd order streams to main channel
- Reduced river stage and flows in panhandle affecting freshwater mussel beds
- Loss of herbaceous aquatic vegetation as hardwood and pine encroaches into wetlands
- Lake bottom drying allow for burning of land bed stimulates desirable aquatic plants (potentially beneficial change)

### Impacts from changes in timing of precipitation:

- Altered water chemistry
- Altered low level trophic interactions – temporal mismatch between phytoplankton and zooplankton
- Reduced connectivity during breeding season

## Estuarine and Marine Ecosystems

### Impacts from decreased precipitation include:

- Nearshore vegetation mortality increase due to salinity decrease
- Increased coral mortality due to decreased light penetration (increased turbidity)
- Increased coral mortality due to increased nutrient loads
- Increased coral mortality due to disease outbreaks
- Increase in frequency/severity of harmful algal blooms
- Altered runoff and buffering ability of the system

### Impacts from decreased precipitation include:

- Decreased freshwater flow and runoff into coastal systems
- Decreased nursery and juvenile habitat
- Increased mortality of vegetation due to increased salinity

### Impacts from changes in timing of precipitation:

- Increased mortality of vegetation due to increased salinity as water chemistry in bays and estuaries change
