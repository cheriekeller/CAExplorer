# Impacts to Ecosystems and Habitats from Changes in Water Chemistry

**TODO:intro paragaph**

See impacts from changes in water chemistry for:

- [Freshwater Ecosystems](#Freshwater)
- [Estuarine and Marine Ecosystems](#Marine)

<hr id="Freshwater"></hr>

## Freshwater Ecosystems

### Impacts from freshwater acidification and other carbon-dioxide chagnes to water chemistry include:

- Increased invasive plant growth for those species that have an affinity for CO2 (e.g., hydrilla)
- Increased damage to host plants by epiphytes due to increased epiphytic growth
- Increased harmful algal blooms due to high nutrient inputs
- Altered community composition â€“ loss of more sensitive species
- Reduced fitness for shell producing species
- Altered growth rates
- Increased eutrophication

<hr id="Marine"></hr>

## Estuarine and Marine Ecosystems

### Impacts from ocean acidification include:

- Decreased coral reef health/productivity due to reduced calcification and/or enhanced dissolution
- Decreased oyster reef health/productivity due to reduced calcification and/or enhanced dissolution
- Decreased coral reef recruitment processes (fertilization, settlement, and post-settlement growth)
- Decline in primary productivity
- Shifts in range of seagrass species
- Increased harmful algal blooms, especially when coupled with increased nutrient inputs
- Increased seagrass production
- Increased production and biomass of epiphytic algae on seagrass leaves
- Increased competition (seagrass and algae)
