# Impacts to Ecosystems and Habitats from Sea Level Rise

Inundation by sea level rise will have direct impacts on ecosystems. Some areas will be lost, while others may have the ability to move inland – depending on rate of sea level rise and presence of barriers. In addition to the direct loss of habitats due to sea level rise, there are many additional impacts expected to occur due to changes in water and soil salinity levels, caused by more frequent exposure through flooding, storm surge and salt spray.

## Coastal and Terrestrial Ecosystems

### Impacts from inundation include:

- Loss of beach and dune habitat where there are barriers to inland migration
- Loss of beach and dune habitat due to increased erosion
- Habitat fragmentation
- Shifts in composition of coastal upland forest habitats as species more tolerant to frequent inundation become more dominant
- Habitat fragmentation
- Loss of most pine rockland communities
- Loss of critical upland forest habitat in the Florida keys

### Impacts from salinity shifts include:

- Loss of coastal upland forest habitat as they transition into other more salt tolerant systems due to increased groundwater and soil salinity
- Alteration in type, abundance and configuration of coastal upland communities as increased groundwater and soil salinity increases cause changes in plant communities (shifts to more salt tolerant species) leading to habitat loss and fragmentation
- Decreased fire frequency/intensity due to loss of fuel (pines, other vegetation) as salinity stress from salinization of groundwater and increased tidal overwash causes reduction in fuel species
- Decoupling of mutualistic relationships as salt-intolerant plants and animals are reduced and/or replaced by salt tolerant species
- Loss of critical upland forest habitat in the Florida Keys
- Reduction/loss of critical freshwater sources in the Florida Keys

<hr id="Freshwater"></hr>

## Freshwater Ecosystems

### Impacts from inundation include:

- Loss of freshwater coastal dune lakes as salt water encroaches into system
- Loss of coastal freshwater marshes – conversion to brackish/salt marsh
- Reduction/loss of critical freshwater sources in the Keys

### Impacts from salinity shifts include:

- Decrease in salt-intolerant vegetation due to increased salinity
- Decrease in coastal and tidal freshwater marshes due to changes in community structure as salinity increases
- Loss of critical freshwater sources in the Keys due to salt water intrusion
- Decreased productivity/growth of vegetation (wild celery)
- Reduction in groundwater due to changes in location/amount of withdrawals for drinking water as salinity increases at some locations
- Loss of suitable habitat for those species with limited osmoregulation

<hr id="Marine"></hr>

## Estuarine and Marine Ecosystems

### Impacts from inundation include:

- Change in type and extent of seagrass due to increased water depth affecting sunlight penetration
- Decreased salinity in Florida Bay as more mixing occurs
- New areas for migration of seagrass and oyster reefs

### Impacts from salinity shifts include:

- Increased habitat for species with broad osmoregulatory adaptations
- Increased habitat in Florida Bay, as salinity decreases with increased water depth, for species sensitive to hypersaline conditions
