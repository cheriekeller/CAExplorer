# Impacts to Ecosystems and Habitats from Changes in Temperature

Changes in temperature can lead to various impacts, depending on the season and duration of the temperature change.

See temperature related impacts for:

- [Coastal and Terrestrial Ecosystems](#Terrestrial)
- [Freshwater Ecosystems](#Freshwater)
- [Estuarine and Marine Ecosystems](#Marine)

## Coastal and Terrestrial Ecosystems

### Impacts from increased average summer temperatures include:

- More frequent and/or more intense wildfire
- Plants species range reductions or shifts
- Reduction of rare communities due to temperature increases exacerbating existing stressors
- Increased competitive pressure on native vegetation as density and distribution increases for other native, more heat-tolerant species

### Impacts from increased minimum winter temperatures (warmer lows) include:

- Reduced fitness, regeneration, and competitive ability due to increased exposure to new pathogens or parasites as diseases/disease vectors respond to warmer temperatures
- Increased mortality of plants due to increased pathogen survival and disease transmission rates
- Pine forests shifting to pine-oak forests
- Northward shift of subtropical and temperate communities

### Impacts from increased temperature extremes include:

#### Colder lows:

- Reduced reproductive/regeneration success due to delayed or interrupted reproduction
- Delayed plant flowering leading to weakening/breaking of linkages between species
- Shift in species distribution due to temperature extremes and interactions of temperature, precipitation and possibly CO2
- Increased die-offs of plants due to extreme cold events
- Limit northern extent/expansion of exotic species range (potential beneficial change)

#### Warmer highs:

- Increased heat stress on plants
- Increased soil temperature and associated changes to soil chemistry and root dynamics
- Increased mortality of plants due to heat intolerance
- Range expansion of native and exotic plant species
- Increased abundance and prevalence of invasive species
- Altered species composition
- Altered community structure
- Altered fire regime
- More frequent and/or more intense wildfires
- Increased impact from pests due to heat stress

## Freshwater Ecosystems

### Impacts from increased average summer temperatures include:

- Reduction or loss of wetland habitats due to increased evaporation rates
- Higher eutrophication rates
- Reduction of submerged aquatic vegetation
- Increased growth rates of aquatic vegetation
- Increase in invasive species that can tolerate higher temperatures and low oxygen
- Increased algal blooms
- Less dissolved oxygen in the system

### Impacts from increased minimum winter temperatures (warmer lows) include:

- Northward range shift of aquatic exotic species
- Increased growth rate and expansion of invasive plant species

### Impacts from increased temperature extremes include:

#### Colder lows:

- Increased mortality for cold temperature sensitive species
- Increased occurrence and severity of cold kill events
- Limit northern extent of exotic species range (potentially beneficial change)

#### Warmer highs:

- Reduction or loss of wetland habitats due to increased evaporation rates
- Higher eutrophication rates
- Increase in invasive species that can tolerate higher temperatures and low oxygen
- Increased algal blooms
- Less dissolved oxygen in the system
- Northward range shift of aquatic exotic species
- Increased growth rate and expansion of invasive plant species

## Estuarine and Marine Ecosystems

### Impacts from increased average summer temperatures include:

- Increased cyanobacteria blooms
- Increased coral mortality due to loss of coral zooxanthellae and bleaching
- Expansion of harmful algal bloom season and persistence
- Less dissolved oxygen in the system

### Impacts from increased minimum winter temperatures (warmer lows) include:

- Increased local extirpations of species at the southern extent of their range
- Expansion of harmful algal blooms season and persistence

### Impacts from increased temperature extremes include:

#### Colder lows:

- Increased mortality of cold temperature sensitive species
- Increased occurrence and severity of cold kill events
- Limit northern extent of exotic species range (potentially beneficial change)

#### Warmer highs:

- Increased cyanobacteria blooms
- Increased coral mortality due to loss of coral zooxanthellae and bleaching
- Expansion of harmful algal bloom season and persistence
- Less dissolved oxygen in the system
- Altered abundance and species composition of seagrasses
- Increased mortality – heat stress
- Reduced reproductive success – coral and mollusk reefs
- Altered growth/biomass
- Increased competition – conditions favoring algae and epiphytes
