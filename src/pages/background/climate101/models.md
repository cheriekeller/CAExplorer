title: Emission Models

Many climate models have been developed to perform climate projections. Specifically, simulating climate change in response to the emission of greenhouse gases and aerosols is the focus of many climate models.

Four new scenarios, called Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were defined in IPCCâ€™s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5; IPCC 2014) and describe four different 21st century pathways of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and atmospheric concentrations, air pollutant emissions and land use. The RCPs include one mitigation scenario leading to a very low forcing level (RCP2.6), two stabilization scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6), and one scenario with very high greenhouse gas emissions (RCP8.5). The RCPs are based on a combination of integrated assessment models, simple climate models, atmospheric chemistry and global carbon cycle models. While the RCPs span a wide range of total radiative forcing values, they do not cover the full range of known and potential emissions. For the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios, radiative forcing does not peak by year 2100 but continues increasing; for RCP4.5 it stabilizes by 2100, and for RCP2.6 it has already peaked and declined (IPCC 2014).

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an international body for assessing the science related to climate change. http://www.ipcc.ch/

The WGIII scenario categories summarize the wide range of emission scenarios published in the scientific literature and are defined on the basis of CO2-eq concentration levels (in ppm) in 2100.
