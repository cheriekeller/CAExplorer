# Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI)

This climate vulnerability assessment is a spreadsheet based process used for rapid assessments of species.

The CCVI identifies the relative vulnerability of plant and animal species that are particularly at risk to the effects of climate change. Information about a species’ natural history, distribution and landscape circumstances are evaluated to predict whether it will likely suffer a range contraction and/or population reductions due to climate change. Scores for each species are developed based on expected impacts to factors such as diet, habitat, and dispersal ability in response to projected changes in precipitation, temperature and sea level rise.

Defenders of Wildlife collaborated with FWC to assess 21 species’ vulnerability using [NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI)](http://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/climate-change-vulnerability-index). See the [full report](http://www.myfwc.com/media/1770251/DOW-FL-VulnerabilityReport.pdf) for more details.

## Florida Species

Species evaluated included species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) (as categorized by FWC) and several non-native invasive species. Species experts were identified and invited to participate in the assessment by individually filling out a worksheet module with multiple parameters to elicit the information required to assign scores.

The CCVI generates an index score that corresponds to one of five categorical ranks:

- Extremely Vulnerable (EV): Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed is extremely likely to substantially decrease or disappear by 2050
- Highly Vulnerable (HV): Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed is likely to decrease significantly by 2050
- Moderately Vulnerable (MV): Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed is likely to decrease by 2050
- Not Vulnerable/Presumed Stable (PS): Available evidence does not suggest that abundance and/or range extent within the geographical area assessed will change substantially by 2050, actual range boundaries may change
- Not Vulnerable/Increase Likely (IL): Available evidence suggests that abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed is likely to increase by 2050

These relative ranks can provide information regarding which species are most vulnerable to climate change, however, it is understanding why a particular species is vulnerable that provides the basis for developing appropriate management responses.

Of the species assessed, birds generally ranked lower on the vulnerability scale. Birds may have an advantage over other groups in that they have very good dispersal abilities. However, several of the species evaluated in this assessment had specific habitat requirements that may limit the degree to which these species may be able to shift their range. Potentially incompatible human responses to climate change, such as coastal armoring, have a significant role in increased vulnerability for some bird species, due to the potential to greatly reduce availability of suitable nesting habitat.

Reptiles tended to rank at the upper end of the scale, ranking as highly vulnerable as a group . Multiple species, including the diamondback terrapin, loggerhead sea turtle, Atlantic salt marsh snake, and American crocodile were identified as extremely vulnerable to climate change. Most of the native reptiles evaluated occur in coastal habitats, and therefore impacted by key factors such as sea level rise and anthropogenic barriers. Barriers may limit habitat migration in response to sea level rise as well as prevent species from tracking habitat shifts.

Of the amphibian species evaluated as part of this assessment, two out of three were rated as "Highly Vulnerable" (gopher frog) or "Extremely Vulnerable" (reticulated flatwoods salamander). Moderate dispersal ability combined with specific hydrologic requirements often contribute to vulnerability to climate change for amphibians.

Among the mammals, those restricted to the Florida Keys ranked higher than the other mammals that were evaluated, including the Lower Keys marsh rabbit (“Extremely Vulnerable”) and the Key deer (“Highly Vulnerable”). Many of the mammals included in this assessment had relatively high dispersal ability, and therefore have the potential to be able to track climate related changes. The Florida panther’s rank of “Not Vulnerable/Presumed Stable” was heavily influenced by the assumption that the species’ habitat will not be vulnerable to climate change.

## How is CCVI measured?

**TODO: brief explanation**

### Exposure:

- Temperature
- Moisture
- Sea level rise
- Natural barriers
- Anthropogenic barriers
- Human responses to climate change

### Sensitivity:

- Dispersal and Movements
- Historical thermal niche
- Physiological thermal niche
- Historical hydrologic niche
- Physiological hydrologic niche
- Disturbance regimes
- Physical habitat specificity
- Biotic habitat dependence
- Dietary versatility (animals) and pollinator versatility (plants)
- Biotic dispersal dependence
- Other interspecific interactions
- Genetic variation
- Phenological response

### Response to Climate Change (optional):

- Documented changes in distribution in response to CC
- Modeled future change in range or population size
- Percent overlap of modeled future range and current range
- Occurrence of protected areas in future distribution
