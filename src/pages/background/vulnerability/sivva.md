# Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment (SIVVA)

The Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment - The Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment (SIVVA; Reece and Noss 2014) is a spreadsheet based vulnerability assessment tool for both species and natural communities. The SIVVA framework includes a mix of quantitative and qualitative criteria and a capacity for the user to set and manipulate the relative importance of criteria. In addition to assessing exposure and sensitivity (vulnerability) and adaptive capacity, SIVVA also includes criteria on conservation value and information availability. When the purpose of a vulnerability assessment is not only to calculate extinction risk but also to prioritize conservation efforts, the relative value of a species and the amount of information available to properly manage that species are extremely important to include.

The SIVVA was use to evaluate the vulnerability of 300 species of conservation concern (Reece et al., 2013) and 30 natural communities (Noss et al., 2014). 83 of these species (primarily vertebrates) are included in this tool.

For more information about SIVVA, please see the [full report](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080658).


### General results:

- Listed species had significantly higher Lack of Adaptive Capacity scores (= less adaptive capacity). They also displayed higher Conservation Value scores.
- Listed species did not consistently have higher Vulnerability scores than non-listed species.
- Amphibians and fishes showed the lowest mean Vulnerability scores while reptiles and invertebrates showed relatively high Vulnerability scores.
- The Conservation Value scores were fairly even across taxa, but highest among mammals and reptiles.
- Information Availability was dramatically lower for invertebrates (= limited information) and highest for birds and mammals.
- Several species were identified as highly likely to go extinct.

### Florida Species Likey to Go Extinct by 2100

Several species were identified as highly likely to be extinct by 2100 due to 2 meters or less of sea level rise combined with other existing or future threats:

* Florida grasshopper sparrow: due to habitat loss, invasive ants, disease
* Miami blue butterfly: due to habitat loss, mosquito control, sea level rise
* Florida duskywing: due to sea level rise, barriers to migration
* Gulf coast solitary bee: due to small range, sea level rise
* Key deer: due to sea level rise, barriers to dispersal, genetics
* Florida Keys tree snail: due to habitat loss to development, sea level rise
* Key tree cactus: due to collection, habitat loss, sea level rise, storm surge
* Bartam’s hairstreak: due to invasive ants, small range, habitat degradation
* Lower Keys marsh rabbit: due to lack of freshwater, sea level rise, barriers to dispersal
* Key ringneck snake: due to sea level rise, barriers to dispersal, genetics


## How were species assessed?

Species were evaluated based on a mixture of quantitative measures and expert knowledge. Experts were asked to rank species for each of thirty criteria.

Each species evaluated received a score in four categories:

- Vulnerability (VU)
- Lack of Adaptive Capacity (LAC)
- Conservation Value (CV)
- Information Availability (IA)

See details about the measures included in each of these categories below.

Using the values for each of these categories, we used four of the SIVVA weighting factors evaluate vulnerability and display the results. Using multiple weighting factors allows visualization of the relative priority of species and their mean priority across multiple competing value systems.

These are based on a weighted percentage from the categories in this order (VU, LAC, CV, IA)

- Emphasis on VU: 45/25/20/10
- Equal weighting: 25/25/25/25
- Emphasis on CV: 20/20/50/10
- Emphasis on both CV and IA: 15/15/35/35

## Detailed results

Note: These results are slightly different than those in the SIVVA publication due the CAE species representing a subset of the SIVVA species.

**TODO: SIVVA images**
<figcaption>Scores for each of the four categories for 1m of sea level rise are provided (Vulnerability, Lack of Adaptive Capacity, Conservation Value, and Information Availability).  Species are listed in order using the average rank value across the four ranking options. The four SIVVA ranking options included here: (1) Equal Weighting, (2) Emphasis on Vulnerability, (3) Emphasis on Conservation Value, and (4) Emphasis on Vulnerability and Information Availability.  Colors represent four classes of vulnerability red = extremely vulnerable, orange = highly vulnerable , yellow = moderately vulnerable, and green = slightly vulnerable. The numbers inside the colored boxes correspond with the species’ rank within each weighting option, with 1 being the most vulnerable.
* Indicates species whose Avg. rank at 3m of sea level rise results in the next higher category.

## Florida Natural Communities With High Vulnerability:

**TODO:find better home for this content**

The vulnerability of natural communities was evaluated using SIVVA, which evaluates ecosystem status, vulnerability and conservation value of the assessed habitats.

These evaluations found that natural communities in southern Florida, especially the Keys demonstrated high vulnerability.  The communities with the highest overall relative vulnerability score include:
* Keys cactus barren
* Pine rockland
* Rockland hammock
* Maritime hammock
* Glades marsh
* Keys tidal rock barren
