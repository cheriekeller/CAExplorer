# Vulnerability to Climate Change

Awareness that change is likely to happen is critical to planning for the future. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the extent and speed of climate change, as well as the ability of species and habitats to adapt. Vulnerability assessments and scenario planning can both help reduce some of the uncertainties.

A critical step in analyzing the potential impacts of current and future climate change is the assessment of the vulnerabilities of species and natural communities. Determining the relative vulnerabilities of habitats and species can lead to the development of more effective management actions and adaptation strategies to enhance resiliency. Additionally, assessing the vulnerability of species or habitats to climate change provides insight into which aspects of climate change may affect a species or community the most. Uncertainty of various types is an important factor to consider when implementing the results of a vulnerability assessment. For example, a high vulnerability to a particular threat, such as altered precipitation patterns, should be modulated by the relatively high uncertainty in precipitation projections relative to the more predictable change in
temperature and sea level rise.

Visualization of potential changes can be achieved through scenario planning. Scenario planning develops a visual or narrative description of plausible future outcomes based on the combination of a range of variables. When the variables are altered, the outcomes of the scenarios change to reflect how these differences are represented or expressed, and how they interact with each other. By applying scenario planning, employing credible information, informed questions, robust models, and a willingness to explore a range of alternatives, the percentage of what is unknown can be reduced to a manageable range of plausible futures. This process allows for informed decision-making to the benefit of biodiversity. By comparing multiple future scenarios, and identifying the strategic issues and causes that led to each of those particular outcomes, the potential impacts of individual decisions or modeled events can be directly visualized, evaluated, and contrasted between scenarios, thereby reducing uncertainty. This information can then be used in support of various vulnerability assessments of natural systems or species persistence across a modeled range of future climate changes.

## What makes a species vulnerable to climate change?

### Biological traits that make species more vulnerable to climate change include:

- Specialized habitat and/or microhabitat requirements. The vulnerability associated with high habitat specialization is compounded when a species has several life stages, each with different specialized habitat or microhabitat.
- Narrow environmental tolerances or thresholds that are likely to be exceeded under climate change
- Dependence on species environmental triggers or cues that are likely to be disrupted by climate change (phenology, e.g. rainfall or temp. cues for migration, breeding or hibernation).
- Dependence on interactions between species that are likely to be disrupted
- Inability or poor ability to disperse quickly or to colonize a new, more suitable range.

## How is vulnerability measured?

Vulnerability can be separated into three elements:

- Exposure: the degree to which a species or habitat is likely to experience climate change factors.
- Sensitivity: the degree to which a species or habitat is likely to be affected by climate change.
- Adaptive capacity: the degree to which a species or habitat can adapt to a changing environment.

Reducing vulnerability will involve decreasing exposure or sensitivity or enabling increased adaptive capacity.

## Vulnerability Assessments

Vulnerability assessments are a suite of tools that reflect the relative and cumulative vulnerability of populations, species, or groups of species comprising a natural community, to stressors. Several vulnerability assessment tools are available and have been implemented throughout Florida and surrounding regions. Each tool focuses on different aspects of vulnerability, often leading to varied results for the same species. For some species it may be critical to assess vulnerability for various life stages.

**TODO: where does this link go?**

Of the 139 species included in this tool, 96 have been evaluated using at least one vulnerability assessment. For the most part, each species was only evaluated in one vulnerability assessment; however, there were some that were evaluated by more than one.

Species were assigned a vulnerability rank based on results from these three assessments.

### Florida Climate Vulnerabilty Assessments

#### [Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI)](/background/vulnerability/ccvi):

Assessed the vulnerability of 22 native species and non-native invasive species, including:

- 5 birds
- 5 reptiles
- 3 amphibians
- 6 mammals
- 3 non-native invasive species

#### [Standardized Index for Vulnerability and Value Assessment (SIVVA)](/background/vulnerability/sivva):

Assessed the vulnerability of 300 species (83 included in this tool) and 30 natural communities, including:

- 30 birds
- 19 reptiles
- 5 amphibians
- 22 mammals
- 4 fish
- 3 invertebrates

#### [Gulf Coast Vulnerability Assessment](/background/vulnerability/gcva):

Assessed the vulnerability of 11 species and 4 habitats within 6 ecoregions across the Gulf Coast, including:

- 6 birds
- 1 reptile
- 2 fish
- 2 invertebrates

#### Combined Vulnerability Index:

An "overall" vulnerability level was developed for all species that were evaluated in one of the vulnerability assessment processes. To accommodate the differences across the three vulnerability assessment approaches, five relative levels are used in this tool.

**TODO: cleanup the following and align with SIVVA detail page**

The Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment (SIVVA) does not produce relative rank categories, but allows for different weighting factors to be applied to determine relative order of the speciesâ€™ vulnerability. A vulnerability rank was assigned to the SIVVA species based on the average rank across the four weighting factors. To be consistent with the SIVVA report results, four levels were assigned to the SIVVA species. See SIVVA results for CAE species.
The four SIVVA levels were further converted to the five CAE levels.

The majority of the SIVVA results presented in this tool are based on the results for 1m of sea level rise. Values associated with 3m of sea level rise were also calculated and evaluated. The SIVVA rank for species with increasing vulnerability due to increasing sea level rise include both ranks, e.g., Moderately to Highly vulnerable.SIVVA

#### [Scanning the Conservation Horizon: A Guide to Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment](https://www.nwf.org/~/media/pdfs/global-warming/climate-smart-conservation/nwfscanningtheconservationhorizonfinal92311.ashx)

This is a broad document put together by the National Wildlife Federation and is intended to help fish and wildlife researchers and managers as well as other conservation practitioners recognize how vulnerability assessments can help them manage natural resources in an era of rapid climate change. The document offers guidance on developing and conducting vulnerability assessments in support of conservation and management missions and is a helpful tool when developing climate change adaptation strategies.

The guide outlines its three primary objectives as follows:

- Provide an overview of the general principles of climate change vulnerability as it relates to species, habitats, and ecosystems.
- Describe the various approaches available for assessing the components of vulnerability and address key issues and considerations related to these tools and practices.
- Highlight examples of climate change vulnerability assessment in practice among government agencies, academic institutions, and other stakeholders.
