# Florida's Species

Florida has more than 16,000 species of native fish, wildlife, and invertebrates, including 147 endemic vertebrate species and approximately 400 terrestrial and freshwater endemic invertebrates. There are currently 82 species designated as federally endangered or threatened in Florida. An additional 59 species are listed as endangered or threatened by the state, including 21 birds, eight mammals, 13 reptiles, four amphibians, nine fish, and four invertebrates.

Climate change impacts on species will be driven by one or multiple climate-related factors acting in concert or synergistically.

This tool includes species profile for 139 species.

## Species Profiles - Introduction

There are 139 individual species profiles included on the Climate Adaptation Explorer (CAE). These species were selected for inclusion based on multiple criteria (species only need to meet 1 criteria):

- Federally listed
- State listed
- Species with a State Species Action Plan
- Specie with a State Management Plan
- Species included in the State Imperiled Species Management Plan
- Species with Habitat Models
- Selected additional species with a Vulnerability Assessment score

Each species profile will include information on life history, range, habitat use, climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation strategies. A map interface will include potential habitat and impacts from sea level rise.

Physical environmental parameters play a major direct or indirect role in determining species distribution, survival and ecosystem sustainability. Many species of fish and wildlife in Florida have limited ranges that are determined in part by climatic conditions and their survival could be threatened by future climatic shifts. This threat is greater for species with narrower tolerance ranges and species occupying habitats in areas where migration or relocation is challenging due to physical barriers. Limited movement/migration pathways include natural (e.g., rivers) and man-made (e.g., roads, land use) barriers. Species with a limited ability to disperse or having specialized habitat requirements, small populations or low genetic diversity are expected to be most at risk.

Florida’s species have migrated and adapted to climate change in the past, but that ability is severely compromised now due largely to human modification of the landscape. Up to 76% of 236 surveyed species were deemed unlikely to be able to relocate inland in response to rising sea levels. Nearly one quarter of the approximately 1,200 species tracked by the Florida Natural Areas Inventory are projected to have at least 50% of their range lost to a sea level rise of 1 m. Several keystone species are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and the loss of these species can have cascading impacts on natural communities and other species.

Species will be impacted by changes in temperature, precipitation, extreme events, sea level rise, and carbon dioxide concentration.

## Impacts to Florida Species

Climate change impacts on species will be driven by one or multiple climate-related factors acting in concert or synergistically.

** TODO: links in following block**
Impacts of climate change on species include: altered community dynamics, altered habitat suitability/geographic range, altered species fitness and survival, altered phenology and physiology, and increased risk of extinction.

Additionally, climate climatic shifts that lead to altered disturbance regimes will have direct and indirect impacts on species. Species that will likely be most vulnerable to climate change are those that have: poor dispersal ability, long generation times, long time to sexual maturity, low reproductive rates, low genetic variability, narrow environmental tolerances, specialized requirements or relationships with other species, specialized habitat and/or microhabitat requirements, a narrow geographic range, or a dependence on specific triggers or cues likely to be disrupted by climate change.

Many generalist species, such as white-tailed deer or raccoons, are likely to continue to thrive in a changing climate. Species, both native and exotic, with traits that assist in invading or colonizing disturbed areas (e.g., ability to change/adjust their range, phenology, and physiology) will have an advantage in a rapidly changing climate.

The biodiversity and ecology of Florida are already suffering from a number of existing stressors, including habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, invasive plants and animals, altered hydrologic regimes, overexploitation, and pathogens, parasites and pollutants. Loss of habitat is the most significant threat to Florida’s species. The effects on species and habitat from existing stressors will likely be exacerbated by climate change. Conversely, the impacts of climate change will be compounded by existing stressors.
