# Increased Risk of Extinction

Species that have limited ranges or dispersal ability, specialized habitat requirements, small populations and/or low genetic diversity are typically the most vulnerable to extinction. As environmental conditions change, these species may not be able to adapt and survive. Species with extensive ranges, long-range dispersal mechanisms, large populations and high genetic diversity are less likely to be at risk of extinction in a changing climate.

**Types of impacts include:**

- Decreased genetic diversity
- Decreased population size
- Increased isolation
- Reduced dispersal
