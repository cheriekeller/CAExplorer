# Altered Species Fitness and Survival

Temperature and moisture availability are predicted to change, which can directly or indirectly affect species. As temperature or moisture variables reach or exceed speciesâ€™ tolerance levels, species may have reduced reproductive success, recruitment, and lifespan. Increased levels of stress may cause some species to be more susceptible to disease and pests. Increased mortality may occur in sensitive species or in areas experiencing more extreme climatic changes.

**Types of impacts include:**

- Decreased longevity
- Increased mortality
- Reduced recruitment success
- Reduced reproductive success
- Increased disease outbreaks
