# Phenotypic Plasticity and Microevolution

Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism to change its characteristics or traits, including morphological, physiological, and behavioral. Species with phenotypic plasticity can quickly compensate for a moderate change in environmental. For example, some species of pond snails exhibit morphological plasticity in that they develop spiny shells, rather than “normal” smooth shells, in the presence of predators. Plants are more phenotypically plastic than animals, because unlike animals, plants are forced to stay put and address various changing conditions with very limited options to move or migrate.

Microevolution is the changes in the gene pool (allele frequencies) of a population over time that result in relatively small changes to the organism. Gene flow, genetic drift, and mutation are pathways for microevolution. These changes happen over a relatively short (in evolutionary terms) amount of time. Development of resistance of pests to pesticides, weeds to herbicides, and pathogens to medicines (e.g., antibiotics) are examples of microevolution.
