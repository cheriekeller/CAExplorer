# Impacts to Species from Changes in Carbon Dioxide Concentration

Examples of impacts from changes in carbon dioxide concentrations include:

**Freshwater chemistry changes:**

- Increased stress
- Increased mortality
- Increased disease, pathogens, parasites
- Reduced reproductive success
- Decreased physiological functions (shell formation)

**Ocean Acidification:**

- Increased mortality (events) in corals and shell-forming organisms
- Decreased metabolic rate
- Depressed immune responses
- Decline in primary productivity
- Decreased growth due to reallocation of resources to maintain calcification
