# Altered Habitat Suitability

The suitability of habitat may shift, as vegetative composition and other key environmental variables respond to climate change. These changes may lead to habitat degradation, fragmentation or loss for some species. Some species may be able to migrate as a means of adapting to shifts in habitat conditions, while others may not as the shifts in suitable habitat outpace their ability to move. Loss of a keystone species from a community can lead to the loss of habitat for many associated species.

Species distributions are influenced through species-specific temperature and precipitation thresholds and, as these thresholds are crossed, species will need to change their movement patterns, shift their ranges, or disperse further distances to reach suitable habitat as they are forced to move away from unsuitable habitat conditions. While climatic changes will lead to contraction of the range of some species, these same changes could lead to the range expansion of other species, particularly non-native invasive species. Migratory species are likely to be strongly affected by climate change.

**Types of impacts include:**

- Changes in nutrient/sediment flows
- Changes in water chemistry and quality
- Habitat degradation
- Habitat fragmentation
- Habitat loss
- Habitat migration
- Loss/movement of nesting sites/locations
- Reductions (or expansions) in species ranges and occurrences
