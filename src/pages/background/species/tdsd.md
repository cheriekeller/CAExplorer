# Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination

The sex of most turtle species and all species of crocodilians is determined by the environment after fertilization. The temperature of the eggs during a certain period of development is the deciding factor in determining sex and small changes in temperature can significantly change the sex ratio. Sex determination is affected by both mean incubation temperature as well as the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuation. Two parameters—the pivotal temperature and the transitional range of temperature—control sex determination in species with TSD. Species with a larger transitional range of temperature are expected to be at a lower risk to climate change.

In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), global climate change may result in a strong sex ratio bias that could lead to significant population declines or extinction. Some species including the snapping turtle, crocodile, and alligator produce males at intermediate incubation temperatures and either females or a mixed sex ratio are produced at extreme (either high or low) temperatures. Whereas, sea turtles and most other turtle species are female-biased at higher temperatures and male-biased at lower temperatures.
