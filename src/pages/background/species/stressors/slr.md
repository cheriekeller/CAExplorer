# Impacts to Species from Sea Level Rise

## Inundation

Many species will lose habitat due to direct inundation by sea level rise. This chart shows projected habitat loss (%) for those species most likely to be impacted by sea level rise. The colored bars represent five categories of percent habitat loss. The height of the colored bars (and numbers at the top of each bar) indicate how many species are included in each of the five categories at three different sea level rise scenarios (1m, 3m and 6m).

## Salinity Shifts

In addition to direct impacts, sea level rise will also impact species through changes in water and soil salinity.

### Impacts from salinity shifts:

- Changes in competition and predator/prey relationships due to de-coupling of mutualistic relationships as salt-intolerant plants and animals are reduced and/or replaced by salt tolerant species
- Changes in species composition as a result of salinity stress related shifts
- Shifts in species presence and abundance due to changes in plant community structure as vegetation responds to changes in groundwater and soil salinity
- Decreased reproductive success in some fish
- Decreased survival rates, increased larval period and decreased size at metamorphosis in frogs due to lower pH
- Loss of critical upland forest habitat in the Florida Keys
- Reduction in extent of occurrence of unique Key species/subspecies
- Decreased range for salt intolerant species in coastal areas and south Florida
- Reduction/loss of critical freshwater sources in the Florida Keys
