# Impacts to Species from Changes in Precipitation

Changes in precipitation can lead to various impacts on species, depending on the amount, intensity, duration and season of the change.

### Impacts from decreased rainfall include:

- Increased avian mortality due to water loss
- Decreased reproductive success of amphibians
- Reduced reproductive success in birds due to decreased availability of arthropods
- Loss of species due to alteration of habitat
- Reduced forage due to drier conditions
- Loss of critical sources of freshwater
- Reduced fitness of freshwater species in tidal creeks due to increased salinity
- Increased mortality of fish and other aquatic species
- Altered macro-invertebrate assemblages in streams
- Altered species ranges due to habitat fragmentation
- Shift in species composition
- Decreased survival of amphibians in ephemeral ponds
- Loss or reduction of some species as biotic interactions are altered
- Increased predator density at limited sources of freshwater
- Altered distribution of species due to increased inshore salinity levels

### Impacts from increased precipitation include:

- Increased mortality of amphibians
- Increased connectivity of in ephemeral wetlands to adjacent wetlands and water bodies
- Reproductive failure for ground-nesting birds due to flooding
- Decreased reproductive success of amphibians
- Increased mortality of larval stages of nearshore fish and invertebrate â€“ decreased salinity
- Decreased survival and fitness of sensitive aquatic species due to increased flow of pollutants
- Reduced food source for aquatic species due to displacement of stored organic carbon
- Scouring of the streambed
- Altered recruitment success of inshore species due to fluctuations in salinity levels in nursery areas

### Impacts from changes in timing of precipitation include:

- Altered interactions between species that depend on seasonal availability of resources
- Altered thermoregulatory responses/tactics of reptiles due to change in amount of sunlight penetrating to the ground as plant growth changes
- Decreased migratory connectivity of aquatic species accessing feeding/breeding grounds
- Decreased survival/reproductive success of amphibians and invertebrates in ephemeral wetlands
- Decreased reproductive success of fish due to lack of connectivity to spawning grounds as timing of flood events change
- Increased mortality of larval stages of fish and invertebrates due to increased salinity as water chemistry in bays and estuaries change
- Altered predator/prey interactions due to changes in timing of migration
