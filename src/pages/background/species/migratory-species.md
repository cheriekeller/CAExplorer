# Impacts to Migratory Species

Migratory species may be impacted at multiple geographic scales, possibly experiencing alterations of habitat in their wintering grounds, breeding grounds, and along their migratory. Mechanisms that aid in migrations, such as wind and water currents, may have positive or negative consequences depending on whether changes increase or decrease required energy expenditures to complete their migration. Altered directions of winds/currents can impact speciesâ€™ ability to navigate to the desired location, even delivering individuals to the wrong location.

Although migratory species are adapted to adjust their behavior with annual changes in the weather, shifts in climatic variables are beginning to result in mistimed migration, with some species abandoning migration altogether and others shifting their migratory pattern. Changes in cues (e.g., temperatures, precipitation) for migration initiation or pathways could lead to mismatched availability of resources required for successful completion of migration or reproductive success and survival upon arriving at the spring or winter destinations.
