# Altered Community Dynamics

As species and habitats respond to shifting environmental variables there will be changes in the species composition within a community.

These changes may lead to changes in availability of food due to increased competition and changes in predator-prey relationships. Many exotic and invasive plants and pest species already possess characteristics that will allow them to take advantage of climatic changes (e. g., highly mobile, opportunistic breeding, wide climatic tolerance) leading to an increase in abundance to such an extent that they have a transformative, and often negative, impact on other species and ecosystems. Native communities under stress from climatic changes may be more susceptible to invasion and other disturbances.

**Types of impacts include:**

- Altered predator-prey relationships
- Altered species composition
- Changes in numbers and density of invasive and introduced species
- Decreased native species diversity
- Increased competition for resources
- Loss of keystone species
