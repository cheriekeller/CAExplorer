# Altered Community Dynamics

As species and habitats respond to shifting environmental variables there will be changes in the species composition within a community.

These changes may lead to changes in availability of food due to increased competition and changes in predator-prey relationships. Many exotic and invasive plants and pest species already possess characteristics that will allow them to take advantage of climatic changes (e. g., highly mobile, opportunistic breeding, wide climatic tolerance) leading to an increase in abundance to such an extent that they have a transformative, and often negative, impact on other species and ecosystems. Native communities under stress from climatic changes may be more susceptible to invasion and other disturbances.

### Impacts include:

- Altered predator-prey relationships
- Altered species composition
- Changes in numbers and density of invasive and introduced species
- Decreased native species diversity
- Increased competition for resources
- Loss of keystone species

## Loss of Keystone Species

A keystone species is a species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance. Such species play a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecological community, affecting many other organisms in an ecosystem and helping to determine the types and numbers of various other species in the community.

Examples of keystone species in Florida include the gopher tortoise, reef building species and the American alligator.

### Gopher Tortoise

The gopher tortoise is considered a keystone species for the sandhill community in that it “engineers” the habitat of many other species. Species that have been reported using gopher tortoise burrows include at least 36 amphibians and reptiles, 19 mammals, seven birds, and more than 300 species of invertebrates. Climatic changes that impact gopher tortoise abundance or survival, such as alterations to fire regimes, will impact a large suite of associated species.

### Reef Building Species

The species that create worm reefs and coral reefs are also considered to be keystone species. Coral reef systems composed of species such as Oculina provide habitat for many recreational and commercially important species, such as scallop, shrimp, grouper, snapper, and amberjack. Changes in circulation patterns, wave actions, sea surface temperatures, and ocean acidification may impact the coral and worm reef species and, in turn, the species that depend upon their structure as habitat.

### American Alligator

The American alligator is considered to be a keystone species of the Everglades ecosystem and wetlands systems throughout Florida, creating important habitat for other species and aiding in ecological processes. The deep holes that they create in the wetland systems retain water during the dry season, providing habitat for a variety of other species. Climate changes, particularly those changes impacting hydrological processes, can cause changes in the alligator’s range or nesting; multiple other species would also be impacted.
