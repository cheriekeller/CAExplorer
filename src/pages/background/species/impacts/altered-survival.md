# Altered Species Fitness and Survival

Temperature and moisture availability are predicted to change, which can directly or indirectly affect species. As temperature or moisture variables reach or exceed speciesâ€™ tolerance levels, species may have reduced reproductive success, recruitment, and lifespan. Increased levels of stress may cause some species to be more susceptible to disease and pests. Increased mortality may occur in sensitive species or in areas experiencing more extreme climatic changes.

**Types of impacts include:**

- Decreased longevity
- Increased mortality
- Reduced recruitment success
- Reduced reproductive success
- Increased disease outbreaks

## Increased Risk of Extinction

Species that have limited ranges or dispersal ability, specialized habitat requirements, small populations and/or low genetic diversity are typically the most vulnerable to extinction. As environmental conditions change, these species may not be able to adapt and survive. Species with extensive ranges, long-range dispersal mechanisms, large populations and high genetic diversity are less likely to be at risk of extinction in a changing climate.

**Types of impacts include:**

- Decreased genetic diversity
- Decreased population size
- Increased isolation
- Reduced dispersal
