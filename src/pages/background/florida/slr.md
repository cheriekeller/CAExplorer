# Sea Level Rise

One of the most direct and pronounced changes due to global climatic change is sea level rise (SLR). While SLR is not technically a climatic change itself (rather a result of major climatic changes), it is associated with specific measurable shifts that result in ecological impacts in much the same way as the other climatic changes described. Easily modeled and quantified at multiple scales, SLR is commonly used as a landscape level example of climate change. Sea level rise is often modeled in defined increments such as feet or meters.

Inundation by increasing sea levels will have variable impacts on ecosystems, depending on various factors including elevation, species composition (salt tolerance), inland migration pathways, and extent.

It is too simplistic to treat SLR as purely a habitat loss or inundation, as some land cover types may expand or shift up inland in the face of SLR. Some habitat and community shifts are likely to occur, especially with a more modest rise in sea levels. However, as the rate of SLR increases, open water will become more prominent as other habitats diminish. When considering the impact of SLR, there will likely be a shift in the natural community structure before being completely lost. With loss of habitat, the impact to species will vary, but in some cases will be extreme. Sea level rise will not impact all coastal areas of Florida to the same degree. Impacts caused by changes in water and soil salinity will vary based on ecosystem type; Coastal, Terrestrial, and Freshwater, and Estuarine/Marine.

Sea level rise will not impact the coastal areas of Florida to the same degree. Multiple variables will influence the type of changes and impacts, including location, coastline complexity, elevation, habitat type, and the presence of barriers to inland migration.

## Resources

#### [NOAA Digital Coast â€“ Sea Level Rise Viewer](http://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/slr)

This tool simulates various SLR scenarios and the corresponding areas that would be impacted by flooding. Additional information about marsh impacts, nuisance flood frequency and social and economic data is also provided.

#### [Sea Level Scenario Sketch Planning Tool](http://sls.geoplan.ufl.edu/#intro)

This tool from the University of Florida can be used to conduct statewide and regional assessments of transportation facilities potentially vulnerable to climate trends.

####[Marshes on the Move](https://coast.noaa.gov/data/digitalcoast/pdf/marshes-on-the-move.pdf)
This report from the NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) and the Nature Conservancy provides a basic understanding of the parameters and uncertainties involved in modeling the future impacts of sea level rise on coastal wetlands.

####[Make Way for Marshes](http://northeastoceancouncil.org/committees/coastal-hazards-resilience/resilient-shorelines/make-way-for-marshes/)
This report from the Northeast Regional Ocean Council that covers the entire modeling lifecycle from developing a modeling approach and working with data to communicating modeling results.

####[The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM)](http://warrenpinnacle.com/prof/SLAMM/)
This model simulates the dominant processes involved in wetland conversions and shoreline modifications during long-term SLR. It relies on digital elevation data to simulate the long-term impact of seal level rise (SLR) on tidal zones. Map distributions of wetlands are predicted under conditions of accelerated sea level rise, and results are summarized in tabular and graphical form. Model developed by Warren Pinnacle Consulting, Inc.
