Even moderate increases in temperature (1 \u00b0C) may cause serious effects on temperate hardwood forests of northern Florida. Some predictions, based on more significant climate change, indicate potential shifting of the ecosystem from forested to open woodland, scrub and savanna. \n\nSome tree species already at their southern range boundaries are predicted to have range reductions, such as southern red oak and American beech in the panhandle, and range contraction of longleaf pine, with the southern boundary moving northward up the Florida Peninsula. Loss of key woody species could affect forest suitability for nesting, roosting, or foraging. \n\nMany of Florida\u2019s upland ecosystems are dependent upon fire.  The ability to maintain these systems through the use of prescribed fire will become more challenging with increased temperatures and changes in precipitation.",
    "sppImpacts": "Species such as the red-cockaded woodpecker rely on the openness of the sandhill for foraging.

Without appropriate fire regimes, trees and other woody vegetation move into dry prairie, creating unsuitable conditions for these and other species.",

Many other species, including redheaded woodpeckers, eastern bluebirds, brown-headed nuthatches, lizards, squirrels and frogs are know to use red-cockaded woodpecker nest cavities.  \n\nGopher tortoises depend on the open herbaceous groundcover.

The park-like ground cover consists of various grasses and herbs, including wiregrass, lopsided Indian grass, bluestems, blazing star, partridge pea, beggars tick, milk pea, queen's delight, and others. \n\nDue to the poor water retention properties of the soils and open canopy, temperature and humidity fluctuate rapidly and frequently in this habitat compared to high-moisture closed-canopy forests. However, many temporary wetlands are found throughout sandhill landscapes and are an integral part of this habitat type, providing breeding and foraging habitat for many wildlife species. \n\nSandhill is a community that is sustained by ground fires with short return intervals to reduce hardwood intrusion and to promote flowering of many grasses and herbs. In the absence of fire, sandhill will eventually succeed into a xeric hammock. Sand pine can quickly invade sandhills where seed sources are available and fires are suppressed.",

Additionally, some plants have reduced reproductive success without frequent fire, as fire is required for their reproduction.  \n\nPlants within mesic flatwoods are already fairly resilient to changes in moisture, having to withstand the stress of soil saturation or inundation during the wet part of the year, as well as dry conditions at other times.  However, extreme drought and heat stress caused by increased temperatures could lead to increased insect outbreaks and mortality. Higher winter air temperatures will increase over-wintering Southern pine beetle larva survival rate, and higher annual air temperatures will allow the beetles to produce more generations per year. Severe drought stress reduces resin production and greatly increases the susceptibility of trees to beetle infestation.  \n\nIncreased summer and winter minimum temperatures, as well as increased extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods) will enhance invasive species processes, from introduction through establishment and expansion.  \n\nCogon grass, old world climbing fern and natal grass are the most significant invasive plants currently found in mesic flatwoods.",
    "sppImpacts": "Alterations to the frequency or seasonality of fire would lead to habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss of mesic flatwoods due to heavy hardwood and shrub encroachment.  Species such as the red-cockaded woodpecker and Sherman's fox squirrel would be impacted as the openness of the flatwoods become more densely vegetated. Loss of mature longleaf pine due to heat induced stress, storms and/or insect outbreaks would reduce the number of suitable nest cavity trees for red-cockaded woodpeckers.  \n\nFlatwoods salamanders and striped newts, dependent upon ephemeral wetlands embedded within the mesic flatwoods for breeding sites, will be affected by changes in precipitation, regardless of direction of change.",

The overstory of pine rocklands contains a single canopy species, South Florida slash pine. The dominant pines tower over a savanna-like understory of saw palmettos, locust berry, willow bustic, beautyberry, broom grasses, silver palms, and a rich herbaceous layer. This community is often associated with rockland hammock and other short-hydroperiod freshwater wetland communities. These sub-tropical pine trees and understory plants have adapted to seasonal wildfires and the lack of soil on the exposed limestone rock. \n\nFire is required for the maintenance of the pine rockland community, with fire frequency ranging from 2 to 3 years to 10 to 15 years, typically burning twice per decade. \n\n Pine rockland communities are globally imperiled and support federal and state listed plant species, such as deltoid spurge and Small\u2019s milkwort which only occur in this habitat.",

Altered fire regimes or the absence of fire, along with other climatic changes, could lead to compositional and structural changes, potentially altering suitability to the current suite of species.  Lack of fire could lead to an increase in wildfire if other management actions are not applied to manage fuel loads. Use of prescribed fire is already very challenging within the pine rockland communities, given their isolated locations, often within a matrix of developed lands. Drought and heat stress caused by increased temperatures can lead to increased insect outbreaks and mortality.  \n\nIncreased extreme events (e.g., storms, droughts, floods) will enhance invasive species processes, from introduction through establishment and expansion.  \n\nBrazilian pepper is the most widespread invasive currently found pine rocklands.  In fire suppressed systems, Brazilian pepper will form a dense, monospecific canopy, almost completely eliminating native vegetation.",
    "sppImpacts": "Pine rocklands provide critical habitat for many south Florida and Florida Keys endemic species.  Many species, including the Key deer, Rim rock crowned snake, and Miami blue butterfly are dependent upon the pine rockland community and may face extinction in the wild if/when the habitat is gone due to sea level rise and other impacts from climate change that render the habitat unsuitable.  Reduction in fire frequency or lack of fire will allow for increased invasion and growth of hardwood species, causing degradation of the habitat for multiple species.  Additionally, altered fire regimes will affect wildlife species due to a reduction of the amount and richness of  understory and herbaceous plants caused by reduced amount of sunlight penetrating the canopy and midstory.  \n\nPatches of dense invasive vegetation would yield areas of unsuitable habitat for all species and increase habitat fragmentation between remaining suitable areas.  \n\nPresence of invasive animals will lead to increased competition for resources and mortality of native species as invasives are often better suited to out-compete the natives.  Impacts due to sea level rise, increased exposure to salinity, and storm events could cause the reduction or loss of key host/food plants for the Miami blue butterfly.  Many of these species are highly restricted within their limited range and are extremely vulnerable to impacts from storms, particularly the Miami Blue butterfly.",

Beaches, dunes, and coastal grasslands and forests are important components of the coastal ecosystem, providing breeding and foraging grounds, and cover for a wide variety of wildlife. \n\nBeaches and dunes are home to threatened species, such as beach mice, snowy plovers, and gopher tortoises, and provide nesting sites for shorebirds and sea turtles. \n\nDunes are created by wind, but are held in place by grasses that trap sand grains as they are being moved across the beach. Dunes stabilized by grasses protect the coast against winds and pounding waves. The vegetation found within Florida's dunes varies and is dependent upon many factors, including storm waves, windblown sand, salt spray, soil type, and climate.",

Loss of pioneer grass species and other dune vegetation likely will increase dune erosion and degradation, especially given the predicted increase in storm events.  \n\nIncreased soil salinity in coastal uplands will lead to changes in species composition as salt-intolerant plants decline and plants with higher salt tolerances increase. Coastal forests are already being impacted by saltwater intrusion, longer periods of root inundation, salt spray, and coastal erosion.  \n\nThe sustainability of some natural coastal systems and the species that depend upon them will be impacted by increases in storm surge associated with hurricanes.",
    "sppImpacts": "Many species are dependent upon coastal areas for all or part of their life cycle. Habitat loss and degradation due to recreational and commercial activities have already led to declining wildlife populations.  Additional impacts from climate change will only exacerbate these threats.  \n\nCoastal systems provide critical habitat for species such as sea turtles, beach mice, nesting and wintering shorebirds and neo-tropical migrants. As habitat is lost due to climate and non-climate factors, nesting shorebirds will be constrained in their ability to move between sites and may become more concentrated in remaining suitable habitat.  This may lead to increased threats from predators as they may be able to find nests more efficiently.  \n\nSea turtle nesting habitat will be impacted due to loss of dunes, increased erosion, and other geomorphological changes.  Increased temperatures may impact sex rations of sea turtle hatchlings.  \n\nBeach mice will be impacted by habitat degradation as dune plant species composition changes (potential loss of food plants), habitat fragmentation as dunes become more disjunct from one another due to inundation, and habitat loss from inundation.",

These two factors can lead to irreversible changes to these islands, including rapid landward migration, decreased island width and height, island breaching and inlet formation, and island segmentation and disintegration.  \n\nStorm events, along with sea level rise, will lead to changes in the structure (geomorphology) of many of the coastal upland systems as wind and storm surge shift sediment and cause increased erosion.  \n\nIncreased soil salinity in coastal uplands will lead to changes in species composition as salt intolerant plants decline and plants with higher salt tolerances increase. \n\nCabbage palm mortality on coastal islands and along the marsh/upland transition zone has already impacted coastal areas along the Big Bend region of Florida.

Sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination, where the sex of the hatchlings is determined by the nest temperature, with warmer temperatures producing more females.

The lake is formed by a broad, shallow, relatively circular depression in bedrock and has a surface area of approximately 1,890 km2 (730 mi2).

Annual length of soil saturation, amount of organic matter, source of water, and fire frequency all contribute to determining the major characteristics of wetlands in Florida. \n\nDecreased precipitation coupled with increased temperature will likely alter species composition and increase fragmentation of larger systems through reduced flow and connectivity.  Decreases in water quantity and quality will continue to stress the system and cause degradation. \n\nClimate change effects that reduce the ability to conduct prescribed burns will contribute to shifts within the ecosystem.  Prescribed fire is used as a management tool to prevent woody vegetation encroachment into marshes and to eliminate invasive exotics that frequently occur at the upland\u2013marsh interface.  \n\nWarming water temperatures, altered stream flow patterns, and increasing storm events will impact river and stream systems. Sea level rise will result in the inland movement of seawater, shifting the tidal influence zone of streams and rivers upstream and permanently inundating downstream riparian/coastal habitats with brackish water. Tidal and storm surges can degrade aquatic habitats through oxygen depletion, changes in salinity, and increased siltation and turbidity.  The suitability of riverine habitats is based on variations in flow, substrate, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and other water chemistry factors. Many aquatic species will be affected by bank erosion, increased siltation, and run-off caused by increased precipitation and storm events. \n\nFlorida\u2019s karst system of sinkholes, submerged caves and springs depend upon the connection between the surface and the underground, with even slight changes in soil moisture, elevation, and temperature causing profound effects.",

Other typical plants include hatpins, marsh pinks, sundews, black-eyed susan, white-top sedge, meadow beauty, yellow-eyed grass, wax myrtle, pitcher plants, tickseed, and panicums.  \n\nThe most important physical factors are hydrology and fire.

    "impacts": "Decreased precipitation coupled with increased temperature will likely alter species composition and increase fragmentation of larger systems through reduced flow and connectivity.  Decreases in water quantity and quality will continue to stress the system and cause degradation. Increased precipitation and floods will cause increased run-off, erosion, siltation, and pollutants, all contributing to habitat degradation and loss.  In some circumstances these impacts could cause decreased reproductive success, increased stress and increased mortality.  For species whose reproductive cycle is linked to wet/dry cycles, changes in the timing and amount of precipitation could affect these life cycle events, potentially causing mismatches of phenological processes, leading to reduced reproductive success, reduced recruitment and increased mortality.",
    "sppImpacts": "Many species of wading birds, including great egret, little blue heron, snowy egret, tricolored heron, and white ibis use wet prairies for foraging.  Increased temperatures and decreased precipitation will lead to loss of suitable foraging sites for wading birds as the timing and duration of dry periods change. Additionally, increased drying of the prairies, leading to more fragmented systems will impact the nesting success of wading birds.  Wading birds\u2019 nesting success is tied to the proximity of nesting and foraging habitats to one another. Nesting success is reduced when foraging sites are located at distances too far away, beyond the birds physiological ability to survive and rear their young.  Other species, such as the sandhill crane, will lose suitable nesting habitat if the wet prairies hydrology (timing and amount of precipitation) is altered.",

Changes in hydrology due to increased temperatures and decreased precipitation will lead to loss of suitable foraging sites for wading birds.  \n\nGlades marsh provides critical habitat for the federally endangered snail kite.  Changes to timing, amount, and duration of precipitation will impact the suitability of this community for snail kites and apples snails (the kites main prey item).  Changes in the amount and type of chemicals in runoff will impact many of the food items (e.g., invertebrates, fish) that wading birds and snail kites depend upon.  \n\nSea level rise will impact a significant portion of this community, leading to alterations in habitat suitability for many of these species as freshwater plants shift to more salt tolerant species and replacement of herbaceous vegetation by woody mangrove species.",

These changes could also lead to the replacement of herbaceous species by woody species. Increased precipitation could permanently connect these isolated wetlands to other water bodies, introducing predators.  \n\nFor species whose reproductive cycle is linked to wet/dry cycles, changes in the timing and amount of precipitation could affect these life cycle events, potentially causing mismatches of phenological processes, leading to reduced reproductive success, reduced recruitment and increased mortality.",

Most pond-breeding amphibians have adaptations to variable hydroperiod conditions; however, if ponds do not hold water for a long enough time during the appropriate season the result can be complete reproductive failure.  \n\nThe timing of salamander's breeding migration is linked to precipitation and temperature, both of which could be impacted by climate change.  Extended periods of drought, leading to complete pond drying, has led to mortality of mole salamanders.   \n\nGopher frogs are dependent upon proximity of suitable wetlands to upland habitats.  Reduction in the number of ponds and increased distance between ponds and suitable upland habitat due to more frequent and longer dry periods will decrease reproductive success and potentially increase mortality of the gopher frog.",

These communities are characterized by an overstory that includes water hickory, overcup oak, swamp chestnut oak, river birch, American sycamore, red maple, Florida elm, bald cypress, blue beech, and swamp ash. \n\nThe understory can range from open and park-like to dense and nearly impenetrable. Understory plants can include bluestem palmetto, hackberry, swamp azalea, pink azalea, lanceleaf greenbrier, poison ivy, peppervine, rattanvine, indigo bush, white grass, plume grass, redtop panicum, caric sedges, silverbells, crossvine, American wisteria, and wood grass.

Longer periods of drought will lead to extensive drying of portions of the swamp, particularly those areas isolated from the river such as meanders and backswamps. Fire does not usually occur in this system; however, frequency of fire may increase if extensive droughts become more common.  Fires may contribute to dominance by cypress, which are somewhat fire-resistant, and lead to damage of the understory species that are not adapted to withstand fires.  \n\nFreshwater tidal swamps are already experiencing mortality and retreat due to increasing saltwater intrusion due to storm surge, drought, and inundation from rising sea levels.  Species composition is changing in these forests as less salt tolerant species die and more salt tolerant species and/or marsh and mangrove species advance.",

Alterations to the hydrology and species composition of floodplain swamps could create unsuitable foraging or nesting conditions for wading birds. Fish dependent on the oxbows and back swamps for breeding grounds will be impacted during periods of drought when these areas remain disconnected from the river.  Species such as the river otter and alligator snapping turtle may lose habitat as areas of deeper water are reduced or eliminated due to decreased precipitation, longer dry periods and drought.  \n\nIncreased temperatures could impact the reproductive success and sex ratios of Alligator snapping turtle hatchlings.  The upper pivotal temperature is approximately 27.5 C, with higher temperatures producing female-biased hatchlings and extreme high incubation temperatures negatively affecting embryo survival.",

However, extreme drought and heat stress caused by increased temperatures could lead to changes in species composition and structure and increased mortality.  \n\nFor species whose reproductive cycle is linked to wet/dry cycles, changes in the timing and amount of precipitation could affect these life cycle events, potentially causing mismatches of phenological processes, leading to reduced reproductive success, reduced recruitment and increased  mortality. \n\nHigher winter air temperatures will increase over-wintering Southern pine beetle larva survival rate, and higher annual air temperatures will allow the beetles to produce more generations per year. Severe drought stress reduces resin production and greatly increases the susceptibility of trees to beetle infestation. \n\nAltered fire regimes or the absence of fire could lead to compositional and structural changes, potentially altering the system's suitability to the current suite of species.  The absence of fire in flatwoods communities can lead to a dense mid-story.  Additionally, some plants have reduced reproductive success without frequent fire, as fire is required for their reproduction.   \n\nIncreased summer and winter minimum temperatures, as well as increased extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods) will enhance invasive species processes, from introduction through establishment and expansion.",

Changes in the timing and amount of precipitation could affect these species' life cycle events, leading to reduced reproductive success, reduced recruitment and increased mortality. \n\nWet flatwoods provide habitat for large, wide-ranging species such as the Florida panther and black bear.  Changes in precipitation and temperature that would lead to fragmentation of these systems would impact the suitability as travel corridors for these species.   Species such as the red-cockaded woodpecker and Sherman's fox squirrel would be impacted as the openness of the flatwoods become more densely vegetated as species composition shifts in response to changes in precipitation patterns and altered fire regimes.",

Typical plant species include laurel oak, live oak, cabbage palm, southern red cedar, and sweetgum. Canopy closure is typically 75%-90%. The sub-canopy layer and ground layer vegetation is highly variable between sites. Wax myrtle is the most frequent shrub in hydric hammock. Other shrubs include yaupon, dahoon, and swamp dogwood. Ground cover may be absent or consist of a dense growth of ferns, sedges, grasses, and greenbriers. Sites are usually between mesic hammocks or pine flatwoods and river swamp, wet prairie, or marsh. \n\nHydric hammock is found in a narrow band along parts of the Gulf coast and along the St. Johns River where it often extends to the edge of coastal salt marshes.",

    "impacts": "Hydric hammock is likely to have 30% of the current area inundated by 1 m of sea level rise and 55% inundated by 3 m of sea level rise.  Increased salinity will lead to species composition shifts as those species with lower salt tolerances are replaced by those that can withstand higher salinity. The ability of this system to migrate inland will depend on the rate of sea level rise and the presence of natural and anthropogenic barriers.  Plant distributions may change due to drought, leading to compositional and structural changes within the system.  \n\nHydric hammocks are typically only inundated for short periods of time following heavy rains; increased wet periods and floods could lead to changes in species composition. Frequency and depth of inundation have a significant effect on oak canopy composition.  As trees become stressed due to heat and drought they may become more susceptible to attack by pests and pathogens.  \n\nIncreased summer and winter minimum temperatures, as well as increased extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods) will enhance invasive species processes, from introduction through establishment and expansion.",
    "sppImpacts": "Hydric hammocks provide valuable habitat for game animals (e.g., white-tailed deer, black bear) that rely on the large production of oak mast (acorns).  Changes in the hydrology of hydric hammocks due to increased or decreased precipitation, increased drought or flooding, or altered timing  of precipitation could lead to shifts in the production and availability of mast.  \n\nHydric hammock seems to be a preferred habitat of feral hogs, which can pose significant problems to the system and species found within it through habitat degradation and competition.  As the hydrology of the hydric hammock is altered, access and damage caused by feral hogs may increase.  Soil disturbances by feral hogs can also allow for the spread of invasive plants.  The subsequent changes would decrease the suitability of this community to species such as the Homosassa Shrew and Sherman's short-tailed shrew.   \n\nFor species whose reproductive cycle is linked to wet/dry cycles, such as the Gulf hammock dwarf siren and the spotted turtle, changes in the timing and amount of precipitation could affect these life cycle events, potentially causing mismatches of phenological processes, leading to reduced reproductive success, reduced recruitment and increased mortality.",

The majority of these lakes were formed or enlarged by dissolution of the underlying limestone by acidic surface waters. Most natural lakes in Florida retain an intimate connection with groundwater, and lack a natural surface outflow. They may be connected to aquatic caves by underground fissures or bedding planes, and thus provide additional habitat for animal species found in those subterranean habitats, or they may have bottom substrates of silt or sand. Most of these lakes have highly variable water levels. \n\nDespite their origin, many Florida lakes are not alkaline, and are vulnerable to acidification. They are commonly nutrient-deficient, thus are vulnerable to nutrient inputs.  \n\nFlorida\u2019s lakes are usually less than 45 feet (14 m) deep, with sand, silt, or organic bottom substrates. Depending on the water chemistry, vegetation in the lakes can vary from nonexistent, to a fringe of emergent plants at the shoreline, to a complete covering of floating plants.  Invasive, non-native aquatic weeds are a major threat to this habitat. Some Florida lakes have held water continuously for 8,000 years, and two exceed 30,000 years in age.  \n\nReservoirs are constructed to collect water for municipal and/or agricultural water use, to provide hydroelectric power, and to improve opportunities for recreational activities (e.g. boating, swimming), and development.

    "description": "Florida\u2019s largest rivers are in the northern part of the state.  Florida rivers, typically flow towards the nearest coast, with the exception of the St. Johns River which flows north to the Atlantic.  The only major river that does not flow to the gulf or to the Atlantic is the Kissimmee River, which flows south and discharges to Lake Okeechobee. Florida's rivers and streams can be divided up into six main categories, including Alluvial, Blackwater, Spring-run, Seepage, Calcareous, and Tidally-influenced Rivers and Streams.  Many rivers are a mixture of these types, transitioning along their path.\n\nAlluvial rivers have large, well-defined drainage basins, carry high sediment loads and have large forested floodplains. These rivers typically flood each year, usually in the winter.  All of Florida\u2019s alluvial rivers are in the Panhandle, including the Apalachicola, Choctawhatchee, Escambia and Ochlockonee.  Due to the high natural turbidity of these streams there is minimal vegetation which is mostly confined to channel edges or backwaters.  \n\nTypical blackwater rivers have dark, stained waters from decomposing plant materials. They typically drain pine flatwoods and cypress swamps.  The flow rate is usually gentle in smaller streams to moderate in larger, but is altogether influenced by seasonal local rainfall. Blackwater streams differ from alluvial streams by having high, steep banks, and by lacking extensive floodplains and natural levees. This habitat is well distributed throughout Florida, except in the regions of north and central Florida dominated by Calcareous Streams, and in the Everglades/Big Cypress region of south Florida, where wetlands and coastal streams dominate the aquatic landscape. \n\nSprings and spring-run rivers are present in the north and central regions of Florida where underlying limestone is close to the surface. Spring-run rivers often represent headwaters or low-order tributaries.  The bottoms of spring runs are generally sand or exposed limestone along a central, stable channel.  Calcareous Rivers occur only in the north and central regions of the state.  These rivers typically have a high pH, high carbonate level, and sand bottom with some limestone exposed. \n\nMost calcareous streams are clear and cool, although in areas where they flow through pinelands or scrub the streams will become stained by the tannins in the vegetation. Some are associated with sinks, where all or sections of the stream flow underground before resurfacing to flow overland.  Submerged plants are frequently dense, and can include tape grass, wild rice, and giant cutgrass.  \n\nTidally influenced rivers and streams includes the freshwater or brackish portions of a river or stream adjacent to an estuary or marine habitat in which the effects of tides cause the rise and fall of water levels. The effect of the tides at the upper limits of influence may lag several hours behind tides on the coast.  Saltwater wedges are formed in many of these systems, enabling numerous species a mechanism to move up or down river. Water flow is bidirectional in coastal tidal rivers and streams; as the tide rises, water flows toward the head of the river and, as the tide retreats, the water flows toward the coastal outlet. These streams bridge the freshwater and marine realms, with aquatic communities ranging from tidal freshwater to tidal brackish; salinities can vary from freshwater to approximately that of seawater. This variation, along with temperature and water clarity, determines the flora and fauna of these streams. Typical plants may include cord grass or submerged aquatic vegetation such as seagrasses and algae.",

Sea level rise will result in the inland movement of seawater, shifting the tidal influence zone of streams and rivers upstream and permanently inundating downstream riparian/coastal habitats with brackish water. \n\nTidal and storm surges can degrade aquatic habitats through oxygen depletion, changes in salinity, and increased siltation and turbidity.  \n\nDecreased precipitation may cause extreme low water levels or even create fragmented/disconnected systems as some areas dry completely, resulting in isolated pools of water rather than a flowing connected system.  \n\nIncreasing air temperature will cause warming water temperatures.  This could be further exacerbated by reduced precipitation, with shallower water areas experiencing more warming.  \n\nIncreased temperatures, as well as extreme events  will enhance invasive species processes, from introduction through establishment and expansion.",
    "sppImpacts": "Species with narrow temperature tolerances will be impacted when water temperatures exceed their maximum threshold.  Additionally, higher water temperatures can increase the stress on the fish, leading to declines in health and increases in vulnerability to parasites and disease.  \n\nSea level rise will increase the salinity levels further up tidal rivers and streams, impacting those species with lower salinity tolerances and shifting community dynamics as more salt tolerant species move in.  \n\nChanges in the timing and rate of flow will affect species that are sensitive to microclimate variations associated with flow dynamics.   \n\nSome species, particularly fish will be impacted by fragmentation of the system (loss of connectivity) that may occur during extended dry periods and droughts.   \n\nIncreased runoff and groundwater pollution as a result of increased precipitation and flooding would significantly alter the nutrient balance and have negative effects on the system and associated wildlife.

Springs typically have high water clarity, low sedimentation, stable channels, and openings that are less than 40 feet (12.2 m) wide.  \n\nIndividual springs are stable systems, with very little change in water temperature, water flow, or chemical composition, but those characteristics can vary from one spring to the next.  \n\nVegetation in spring and spring run habitats consist of submerged aquatic vegetation, aquatic algae covering limestone outcroppings, and species such as tape grass, wild rice, and giant cutgrass located in the spring runs. \n\nThe constant temperatures of springs provide essential habitat for manatees and some species of fish.  There are 1,089 mapped springs, with 33 first magnitude springs (springs that discharge water at a rate of at least 2800 liters or 100 cubic feet  of water per second).",

There will be additional impacts to springs from sea level rise as saltwater intrusion occurs through groundwater.   \n\nIncreased precipitation could lead to increased nutrient, sediment and pollutant loading within the system.   \n\nIncreased temperatures, as well as extreme events  will enhance invasive species processes, from introduction through establishment and expansion.",
    "sppImpacts": "Changes in the intensity and frequency of storm events and extreme conditions (e.g., drought, floods) will affect the amount of stormwater runoff entering the springs.  Increased nutrient concentrations and chemical pollutants carried in runoff will impact water quality and clarity and contribute to algae blooms that impact native vegetation and interfere with the spring's ecosystem.  \n\nMany species such as the West Indian manatee, American eel and American shad spend time in both the freshwater springs the marine environment.  Connectivity between the spring and the ocean is important, but could be impacted due to increased drought and lowered ground water levels.  \n\nThe loggerhead musk turtle is rarely found outside of Florida's springs and forages for algae, insects and snails.  Water quality degradation that impacts the insects and snails would eliminate critical food sources for this turtle.  \n\nWater quality and clarity degradation could impact the spring and spring run vegetation, which manatees are forage on, particularly important during cold weather events when they congregate in the springs.  \n\nThere are multiple species that are found only in springs, including Albino cave crayfish and spring crayfish, that are very sensitive to changes in water quality.",

    "description": "Florida\u2019s estuarine and marine ecosystems include the waters and sub-tidal zones of estuaries, semi-enclosed bays and lagoons, and open ocean, as well as seagrasses, coastal marshes, mangroves, and various types of reed such as oyster reefs, coral reefs or rocky reefs.  \n\nMangroves are one of the most productive habitats, providing integral nursery habitats for fish species.  Shorelines fringed by mangrove prop roots harbor diverse fish assemblages in high densities. Biscayne Bay has the longest stretch of mangrove shoreline left on the east coast of the U.S. Mangroves also provide shoreline protection from wind, waves, and erosion. \n\nThe most extensive salt marshes in Florida begin in northwest Florida at the mouth of the Ochlockonee River near Apalachicola and end in New Port Richey.  Florida has many large bays and lagoons, including Apalachee Bay, Tampa Bay, Charlotte Harbor, Florida Bay and the Indian River lagoon. The combination of freshwater and saltwater wetlands, seagrass and mangrove communities, contribute valuable cover, foraging areas, and reproductive habitats for many fish and wildlife species. \n\nSeagrasses are found in protected bays, lagoons, and other shallow coastal waters.  Seagrass communities provide feeding grounds, nursery areas, and protective cover for a diversity of marine species.  Additionally, seagrasses stabilize bottom sediments and aid in preventing erosion during storm events. \n\nThe Florida reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental US and is the third largest in the world.  It extends almost 200 miles long and has more than 6,000 individual reefs in the system.  Over 30 different kinds of corals are found in Florida waters.

    "impacts": "The three primary climate change drivers that impact estuarine and marine habitats are sea level rise, increasing ocean temperatures and ocean acidification.  Sea level rise and associated increases in water depth will decrease light availability and impact seagrass distribution, productivity, and structure.  Even small changes in water temperatures can have profound effects, especially where coral reefs, seagrasses, and mangroves predominate.    Increasing ocean temperatures lead to lower oxygen levels in the surface water and higher evaporation rates increases the sea surface salinity.  Both factors, low oxygen and increased salinity can lead to stress and decreased reproductive success.  One of the primary effects of increased temperature on seagrass will be the alteration of growth rates and other physiological functions of the plants.  Over recent years, modest sea surface temperature increases have resulted in catastrophic impacts to the world\u2019s coral reefs at the global, regional, and Florida-wide scales.  Since corals play a pivotal role in supporting biodiversity, harboring the highest diversity of marine species, impacts to their long-term survival can have devastating effects on reef-associated biodiversity.  \n\nAdditionally, estuarine productivity will be impacted by changes in the timing and amount of freshwater, nutrient, and sediment delivery.  Species may be impacted as salinity levels shift due to changes in precipitation and freshwater input, favoring those species more tolerant of a range of salinity levels.  Increased runoff will impact water quality by increasing nutrients, pollutants, and turbidity.   \n\nBoth saltwater marsh and mangroves may be able to keep pace with sea level rise and other climatic changes. Relatively small changes in winter climate can result in dramatic mangrove range expansion to the north.  However, this may be at the expense of saltwater marsh, as mangroves expand into areas occupied by saltwater marsh vegetation. This loss may be balanced as other inland habitats transition to saltwater marsh as they become inundated.  The inland migration of saltwater marsh will be limited by natural and human-built barriers.",
    "sppImpacts": "Many species of birds use the mangrove canopy as nesting sites, including wading birds, mangrove cuckoos, and white-crowned pigeons. Saltmarsh-dependent bird species such as seaside sparrows may be forced to leave the area if suitable habitat no longer exists. \n\nImpacts to corals long-term survival can have devastating effects on reef-associated biodiversity. Most of Florida's sport fish species and many other marine animals spend significant parts of their lives (particularly early development stages) on or around coral reef habitats.  Warmer water temperatures can lead to increased negative effects of diseases on species, as pathogens are generally favored by warmer temperatures relative to their hosts.",

    "description": "Bays are found along the coast of Florida, connecting to either the Gulf of Mexico on the west coast or the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast.  Tampa Bay is the largest estuary in Florida, other bays include Pensacola Bay, Apalachicola Bay, Charlotte Harbor, Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay.  \n\nBays receive freshwater inflow from rivers, streams and wetlands.  \n\nInlets are natural or man-made cuts in the shoreline that link coastal and inland water bodies. This habitat is defined as the subtidal area within a two-kilometer radius of the central part (i.e., throat) of the Inlet. Both bays and inlets tend to be hot spots of biodiversity and are critical in the recruitment of many fish and invertebrate species. They provide habitat for the settling larvae from coastal areas and provide an emigration conduit for outgoing juveniles. They also are essential spawning habitat for several marine fishes.  \n\nBivalve Reefs occur in both intertidal and subtidal zones to depths of 40 feet (12 m). In Florida the most extensive examples of this habitat, dominated by oysters, are restricted to estuarine environments where salinity concentrations range from 15 to 30 parts per thousand. Events or processes that alter freshwater deliveries to estuaries are detrimental to this habitat. Bivalve reefs are a diverse ecological community that provides nursery grounds, refugia, and foraging areas to a wide variety of wildlife species. \n\nTidal flats are non-vegetated areas of sand or mud protected from wave action and composed primarily of mud transported by tidal channels. An important characteristic of the tidal flat environment is its alternating tidal cycle of submergence and exposure to the atmosphere. \n\nThe open ocean (pelagic) environment includes the waters lying over the continental shelf (neritic zone) and waters beyond the continental shelf. The Pelagic community lives in the water column above the seafloor and below the surface. This community does not depend on the seabed, although its members may visit it occasionally. Maximum depths vary from approximately 30 feet (9 m) in the Gulf of Mexico to more than 1,000 feet (304 m) off of the Florida Keys and southeast Florida.",

Mangroves may extirpate shade-intolerant marsh species. The size of a salt marsh depends on the extent of the intertidal zone in which it occurs. Salt marshes of larger sizes are usually dissected by numerous tidal creeks. Areas that have low topographic relief and relatively high tidal ranges are likely to have larger salt marsh extents. \n\nWithin salt marsh, plant species are often distributed unevenly, especially in transitional areas. Species distributions are affected by biotic and abiotic variables such as elevation, substrate type, degree of slope, wave energy, competing species, and salinity. Smooth cordgrass typically occupies the lower elevations and is usually adjacent to tidal creeks and pools. Needlerush dominates the slightly less frequently inundated zone. Vegetation at the higher elevations forms transitional areas to uplands and may contain species such as marsh-hay, glassworts, saltwort, saltgrass, sea ox-eye daises, marsh-elder, and saltbush as well as many other species. \n\nThe salt marsh habitat is among the most productive communities in the world.

    "sppImpacts": "Saltwater marsh species such as the black rail, salt marsh voles, and marsh wrens may lose habitat due to sea level rise, if there are barriers to saltmarsh inland migration or if saltwater marsh plants can't keep pace with the rate of sea level rise.  \n\nWith increasing temperatures and fewer cold weather events, species may lose saltwater marsh habitat to mangrove habitat in the northern portions of their range due to mangrove range expansion.  \n\nSome species such as the Lower Keys marsh rabbit and silver rice rat, both found in the Florida Keys, are predicted to lose 100% of their habitat with 1m of sea level rise and don't have any options for migration.  \n\nFluctuations in freshwater inputs due to changes in precipitation patterns can lead to decreased prey availability, decreased reproductive success, decreased recruitment, and increased mortality in fish and invertebrates species.",

    "description": "A coral reef is an epibenthic community; a concentrated topographic complex of massive corals and other sessile organisms (algae, bryozoans) that build calcium carbonate (limestone) skeletons. The structural complexity provides habitat for a highly diverse flora and fauna that live all or portions of their lives on coral reefs.  Two major Coral Reef types are recognized: patch reefs and offshore bank reefs. \n\nBank Reefs are further defined by zones (e.g., reef flat, spur and groove). The types of coral reefs found off the coast of Florida include the shallow-wave resistant reefs in the region from Dry Tortugas to Martin County; deeper (30-130 ft.; 10-40 m) reefs in the same region; the Oculina Banks seaward of Palm Beach to Vero Beach. Deep water (165-265 ft.; 50-80 m) structures such as Pulley Ridge and the Florida Middle Grounds occur along the west Florida shelf break in federal waters.  \n\nHard Bottom is characterized as mixed communities of algae, sponges, octocorals and stony corals. This habitat occurs in subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal zones throughout Florida's coastal waters. Hard Bottom is composed of attendant epibenthic biota on a rocky substrate composed of coquina, limestone, or relic coral, molluscan, and annelid reefs. Coquina is a limestone composed of broken shell debris. Limestone rock (many different strata) occurs as high- or low-relief outcrops of calcium carbonate. \n\nRelic reefs are the skeletal remains of once-living reefs such as the Vermetid Reef built by worm-like gastropod mollusks, Petaloconchus. These reefs are only known to be found in shallow waters seaward of the outer islands in the Ten Thousand Islands area of southwest Florida.\n\nHard bottom biological communities are structured by depth and latitude and inhabited by sessile, planktonic, epifaunal, and pelagic plants and animals; infaunal organisms are present in interstitial soft bottom substrate. In the region south of Stuart on the east coast of Florida and Bay Port on the west coast, subtidal hard bottom communities are characteristically inhabited by soft corals (octocorals) and sponges. Octocoral beds have dense concentrations of sea fans, sea plumes, and sea feathers. Mobile species found in octocoral beds include flamingo tongue shell, purple shrimp, and basket starfish. \n\nSponge beds include the branching, vase, tube, Florida loggerhead, and sheepswool sponges. Other mobile fauna found in both the octocoral beds and the sponge beds include amphipods, isopods, burrowing shrimp, crabs, sand dollars, and many species of fish. Although the coral species found in Hard Bottom habitat are not reef-building, they do contribute to the three-dimensional nature of the areas by increasing the surface area for sessile organisms and by providing important refuges for a variety of fish and invertebrates.",

Ocean acidification and temperature increases may lead to shifts from coral dominated reefs to  reefs dominated by algae or sponges.  Increased ocean acidity will reduce calcification and compromise skeletal structure of coral reefs.   \n\nIncreased precipitation will lead to increased runoff, impacting water quality by increasing nutrients, pollutants, and turbidity. It can take years for coral reefs to recover from damage incurred by storms and increasing storm frequency will reduce the odds of recovery between disturbance events.",

Factors that affect the establishment and growth of seagrass include light availability, water temperature, salinity, sediment composition, nutrient levels, wave energy, and tidal range. \n\nSeagrass most often occurs in areas of low to moderate current velocities where the water is clear; thereby allowing sunlight to penetrate to the leaf blades. \n\nSeagrass communities are highly productive, faunally rich, and ecologically important systems.

Some grass beds may not persist due to shoreline construction and armoring impeding their shoreward migration. Increased water temperature may lead to shifts in range and extent of seagrass species, as species in North Florida are replaced by more tropical species.  \n\nIncreased salinity due to decreased freshwater input and increased evaporation rates can cause physiological stress to the vegetation.  \n\nLarge-scale die-offs of seagrass in Florida Bay have been attributed to hypoxia and sulfide production driven by warm, hypersaline waters.  Increased water temperature and nutrient enrichment together promote hypoxia and harmful algal blooms.   Increased precipitation will lead to increased runoff, impacting water quality by increasing nutrients, pollutants, and turbidity.",
    "sppImpacts": "Florida's seagrass beds are vital for providing foraging, refugia and nursery habitat for numerous fish, shellfish, manatees and sea turtles.  Changes in water quality and clarity that impact the health, distribution, and abundance of seagrass beds will impact the health, reproductive success and survival of a multitude of species.  \n\nDegradation or loss of seagrass beds will impact reproductive success, recruitment and survival of many species that depend on it as nursery habitat.  The sea squirt and mollusks attach larvae and eggs to the seagrass leaves, while other juvenile fish and invertebrates use the seagrass beds as refugia, concealing themselves from predators.  \n\nThe loss of seagrass beds will further exacerbate degraded water quality due to the loss of the substrate stabilizing function seagrass provides.

    "description": "Keys tidal rock barren is a flat rockland with exposed limestone in supratidal zone.  it is inundated by salt water only during extreme high tides.  This community is restricted to the Florida keys on limestone bedrock along shores facing both Florida Bay and the Straits of Florida.  It consists of mainly herbaceous vegetation of upper tidal marsh species and stunted shrubs and tree, including buttonwood, perennial glasswort, saltwort, seaside oxeye, saltgrass, seashore dropseed, and marsh fimbry. \n\nFire does not occur in this community.",

The plants found here are already highly adapted to isolated patches and high salinity levels.  However, due to the isolated and patchy nature of this community and its association with flat exposed limestone, it is not likely that it will be able to successfully migrate inland to new suitable sites as sea levels rise.",
