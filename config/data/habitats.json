Even moderate increases in temperature (1 \u00b0C) may cause serious effects on temperate hardwood forests of northern Florida. Some predictions, based on more significant climate change, indicate potential shifting of the ecosystem from forested to open woodland, scrub and savanna. \n\nSome tree species already at their southern range boundaries are predicted to have range reductions, such as southern red oak and American beech in the panhandle, and range contraction of longleaf pine, with the southern boundary moving northward up the Florida Peninsula. Loss of key woody species could affect forest suitability for nesting, roosting, or foraging. \n\nMany of Florida\u2019s upland ecosystems are dependent upon fire.  The ability to maintain these systems through the use of prescribed fire will become more challenging with increased temperatures and changes in precipitation.",

Beach dunes are characterized as wind-deposited, foredune and wave-deposited upper beach that are sparsely to densely vegetated with pioneer species, especially sea oats.  Vegetation on beach dunes varies regionally in Florida but is restricted to a few highly specialized terrestrial plants.   Typical plants include beach cordgrass, sand spur, railroad vine, beach morning glory, dune sunflower, sea purslane, and sea rocket.  The dune vegetation must be able to tolerate loose, dry, unstable, nutrient poor soils, as well as exposure to wind, salt spray, sand abrasions, intense sunlight, and storms.  \n\nBeach dunes are  periodically inundated by seawater during extreme high tides and storms. This community is subject to drastic topographic alterations during winter storms and hurricanes.  \n\nFlorida beaches are important nesting sites for several species of shorebirds and wintering grounds for others.",

Altered fire regimes and the increased use of alternative management techniques may impact forest suitability for various species.  \n\nIncreased summer and winter minimum temperatures, as well as extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods) will enhance invasive species processes, from introduction through establishment and expansion.  \n\nWarmer winter air temperatures will increase over-wintering Southern pine beetle larva survival rate, and higher annual air temperatures will allow the beetles to produce more generations per year. Severe drought stress reduces resin production and greatly increases the susceptibility of trees to beetle infestation.   \n\nIncreased temperatures, decreased precipitation, along with increased stress of tress will lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires. \n\nIncreased temperatures will promote the growth of some forage crops but decrease the nutrient availability.",

Increased fragmentation will lead to loss of habitat and loss of key corridors for species. Several types of working landscapes can provide the appropriate mix of nesting and foraging habitat for Florida sandhill cranes.  \n\nThe suitability of the shallow wetlands for nesting will be impacted if timing and amount of precipitation changes, leading to a decrease in reproductive success.  If wetlands are too dry during nesting they would not provide adequate habitat or if they dry during the incubation period it would allow for increased nest predation by terrestrial predators.  If precipitation increases during the nesting season the nest will flood, leading to nest failure. Audubon's crested caracara's territory usually includes open pasture or ranchland and embedded wetlands surrounding  clumps of cabbage palm.  \n\nAs impacts form climate change occur, the availability of these components in the appropriate matrix could be altered.  Additionally, suitable caracara habitat may be lost if land use type is shifted to more intensive agricultural operations or converted to residential/commercial development in response to climate change.",

The lake is formed by a broad, shallow, relatively circular depression in bedrock and has a surface area of approximately 1,890 km2 (730 mi2). The lake was the source of the Everglade\u2019s sheetflow which sustained the Everglades and nourished Florida Bay and coastal estuaries.  \n\nA significant portion of Florida\u2019s landscape is covered by wetlands, ranging from expansive systems (e.g., Everglades, Big Cypress, Paynes Prairie) to isolated features located in a mosaic of upland communities (e.g., ephemeral wetlands, pitcher plant bogs).  \n\nThe Florida Everglades is unique in the world, combining both temperate and tropical flora in a widely shifting mosaic of habitats. \n\nForested wetlands are found as floodplains along major rivers systems and as large connected systems, particularly in south Florida.

Annual length of soil saturation, amount of organic matter, source of water, and fire frequency all contribute to determining the major characteristics of wetlands in Florida. \n\nDecreased precipitation coupled with increased temperature will likely alter species composition and increase fragmentation of larger systems through reduced flow and connectivity.  Decreases in water quantity and quality will continue to stress the system and cause degradation. \n\nClimate change effects that reduce the ability to conduct prescribed burns will contribute to shifts within the ecosystem.  Prescribed fire is used as a management tool to prevent woody vegetation encroachment into marshes and to eliminate invasive exotics that frequently occur at the upland\u2013marsh interface.  \n\nWarming water temperatures, altered stream flow patterns, and increasing storm events will impact river and stream systems. Sea level rise will result in the inland movement of seawater, shifting the tidal influence zone of streams and rivers upstream and permanently inundating downstream riparian/coastal habitats with brackish water. Tidal and storm surges can degrade aquatic habitats through oxygen depletion, changes in salinity, and increased siltation and turbidity.  The suitability of riverine habitats is based on variations in flow, substrate, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and other water chemistry factors. Many aquatic species will be affected by bank erosion, increased siltation, and run-off caused by increased precipitation and storm events. \n\nFlorida\u2019s karst system of sinkholes, submerged caves and springs depend upon the connection between the surface and the underground, with even slight changes in soil moisture, elevation, and temperature causing profound effects.",

Frequency and depth of inundation have a significant effect on oak canopy composition.  As trees become stressed due to heat and drought they may become more susceptible to attack by pests and pathogens.  \n\nIncreased summer and winter minimum temperatures, as well as increased extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods) will enhance invasive species processes, from introduction through establishment and expansion.",
    "sppImpacts": "Hydric hammocks provide valuable habitat for game animals (e.g., white-tailed deer, black bear) that rely on the large production of oak mast (acorns).  Changes in the hydrology of hydric hammocks due to increased or decreased precipitation, increased drought or flooding, or altered timing  of precipitation could lead to shifts in the production and availability of mast.  \n\nHydric hammock seems to be a preferred habitat of feral hogs, which can pose significant problems to the system and species found within it through habitat degradation and competition.  As the hydrology of the hydric hammock is altered, access and damage caused by feral hogs may increase.  Soil disturbances by feral hogs can also allow for the spread of invasive plants.

They may be connected to aquatic caves by underground fissures or bedding planes, and thus provide additional habitat for animal species found in those subterranean habitats, or they may have bottom substrates of silt or sand. Most of these lakes have highly variable water levels. \n\nDespite their origin, many Florida lakes are not alkaline, and are vulnerable to acidification.

    "description": "Florida\u2019s largest rivers are in the northern part of the state.  Florida rivers, typically flow towards the nearest coast, with the exception of the St. Johns River which flows north to the Atlantic.  The only major river that does not flow to the gulf or to the Atlantic is the Kissimmee River, which flows south and discharges to Lake Okeechobee. Florida's rivers and streams can be divided up into six main categories, including Alluvial, Blackwater, Spring-run, Seepage, Calcareous, and Tidally-influenced Rivers and Streams.  Many rivers are a mixture of these types, transitioning along their path.\n\nAlluvial rivers have large, well-defined drainage basins, carry high sediment loads and have large forested floodplains. These rivers typically flood each year, usually in the winter.  All of Florida\u2019s alluvial rivers are in the Panhandle, including the Apalachicola, Choctawhatchee, Escambia and Ochlockonee.  Due to the high natural turbidity of these streams there is minimal vegetation which is mostly confined to channel edges or backwaters.  \n\nTypical blackwater rivers have dark, stained waters from decomposing plant materials. They typically drain pine flatwoods and cypress swamps.  The flow rate is usually gentle in smaller streams to moderate in larger, but is altogether influenced by seasonal local rainfall. Blackwater streams differ from alluvial streams by having high, steep banks, and by lacking extensive floodplains and natural levees. This habitat is well distributed throughout Florida, except in the regions of north and central Florida dominated by Calcareous Streams, and in the Everglades/Big Cypress region of south Florida, where wetlands and coastal streams dominate the aquatic landscape. \n\nSprings and spring-run rivers are present in the north and central regions of Florida where underlying limestone is close to the surface. Spring-run rivers often represent headwaters or low-order tributaries.  The bottoms of spring runs are generally sand or exposed limestone along a central, stable channel.  Calcareous Rivers occur only in the north and central regions of the state.  These rivers typically have a high pH, high carbonate level, and sand bottom with some limestone exposed. \n\nMost calcareous streams are clear and cool, although in areas where they flow through pinelands or scrub the streams will become stained by the tannins in the vegetation. Some are associated with sinks, where all or sections of the stream flow underground before resurfacing to flow overland.  Submerged plants are frequently dense, and can include tape grass, wild rice, and giant cutgrass.  \n\nTidally influenced rivers and streams includes the freshwater or brackish portions of a river or stream adjacent to an estuary or marine habitat in which the effects of tides cause the rise and fall of water levels. The effect of the tides at the upper limits of influence may lag several hours behind tides on the coast.  Saltwater wedges are formed in many of these systems, enabling numerous species a mechanism to move up or down river. Water flow is bidirectional in coastal tidal rivers and streams; as the tide rises, water flows toward the head of the river and, as the tide retreats, the water flows toward the coastal outlet. These streams bridge the freshwater and marine realms, with aquatic communities ranging from tidal freshwater to tidal brackish; salinities can vary from freshwater to approximately that of seawater. This variation, along with temperature and water clarity, determines the flora and fauna of these streams. Typical plants may include cord grass or submerged aquatic vegetation such as seagrasses and algae.",

    "impacts": "The three primary climate change drivers that impact estuarine and marine habitats are sea level rise, increasing ocean temperatures and ocean acidification.  Sea level rise and associated increases in water depth will decrease light availability and impact seagrass distribution, productivity, and structure.  Even small changes in water temperatures can have profound effects, especially where coral reefs, seagrasses, and mangroves predominate.    Increasing ocean temperatures lead to lower oxygen levels in the surface water and higher evaporation rates increases the sea surface salinity.  Both factors, low oxygen and increased salinity can lead to stress and decreased reproductive success.  One of the primary effects of increased temperature on seagrass will be the alteration of growth rates and other physiological functions of the plants.  Over recent years, modest sea surface temperature increases have resulted in catastrophic impacts to the world\u2019s coral reefs at the global, regional, and Florida-wide scales.  Since corals play a pivotal role in supporting biodiversity, harboring the highest diversity of marine species, impacts to their long-term survival can have devastating effects on reef-associated biodiversity.  \n\nAdditionally, estuarine productivity will be impacted by changes in the timing and amount of freshwater, nutrient, and sediment delivery.  Species may be impacted as salinity levels shift due to changes in precipitation and freshwater input, favoring those species more tolerant of a range of salinity levels.  Increased runoff will impact water quality by increasing nutrients, pollutants, and turbidity.   \n\nBoth saltwater marsh and mangroves may be able to keep pace with sea level rise and other climatic changes. Relatively small changes in winter climate can result in dramatic mangrove range expansion to the north.  However, this may be at the expense of saltwater marsh, as mangroves expand into areas occupied by saltwater marsh vegetation. This loss may be balanced as other inland habitats transition to saltwater marsh as they become inundated.  The inland migration of saltwater marsh will be limited by natural and human-built barriers.",
    "sppImpacts": "Many species of birds use the mangrove canopy as nesting sites, including wading birds, mangrove cuckoos, and white-crowned pigeons. Saltmarsh-dependent bird species such as seaside sparrows may be forced to leave the area if suitable habitat no longer exists. \n\nImpacts to corals long-term survival can have devastating effects on reef-associated biodiversity. Most of Florida's sport fish species and many other marine animals spend significant parts of their lives (particularly early development stages) on or around coral reef habitats.  Warmer water temperatures can lead to increased negative effects of diseases on species, as pathogens are generally favored by warmer temperatures relative to their hosts.",

Tampa Bay is the largest estuary in Florida, other bays include Pensacola Bay, Apalachicola Bay, Charlotte Harbor, Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay.  \n\nBays receive freshwater inflow from rivers, streams and wetlands.  \n\nInlets are natural or man-made cuts in the shoreline that link coastal and inland water bodies. This habitat is defined as the subtidal area within a two-kilometer radius of the central part (i.e., throat) of the Inlet. Both bays and inlets tend to be hot spots of biodiversity and are critical in the recruitment of many fish and invertebrate species. They provide habitat for the settling larvae from coastal areas and provide an emigration conduit for outgoing juveniles. They also are essential spawning habitat for several marine fishes.  \n\nBivalve Reefs occur in both intertidal and subtidal zones to depths of 40 feet (12 m). In Florida the most extensive examples of this habitat, dominated by oysters, are restricted to estuarine environments where salinity concentrations range from 15 to 30 parts per thousand. Events or processes that alter freshwater deliveries to estuaries are detrimental to this habitat. Bivalve reefs are a diverse ecological community that provides nursery grounds, refugia, and foraging areas to a wide variety of wildlife species. \n\nTidal flats are non-vegetated areas of sand or mud protected from wave action and composed primarily of mud transported by tidal channels. An important characteristic of the tidal flat environment is its alternating tidal cycle of submergence and exposure to the atmosphere. \n\nThe open ocean (pelagic) environment includes the waters lying over the continental shelf (neritic zone) and waters beyond the continental shelf. The Pelagic community lives in the water column above the seafloor and below the surface. This community does not depend on the seabed, although its members may visit it occasionally.

This community type occurs within the intertidal zone of coastal areas and may be infrequently (high marsh) to frequently (low marsh) inundated by salt or brackish water. \n\nSalt marsh develops where wave energies are low and where mangroves are absent. Mangroves may extirpate shade-intolerant marsh species. The size of a salt marsh depends on the extent of the intertidal zone in which it occurs. Salt marshes of larger sizes are usually dissected by numerous tidal creeks. Areas that have low topographic relief and relatively high tidal ranges are likely to have larger salt marsh extents. \n\nWithin salt marsh, plant species are often distributed unevenly, especially in transitional areas. Species distributions are affected by biotic and abiotic variables such as elevation, substrate type, degree of slope, wave energy, competing species, and salinity. Smooth cordgrass typically occupies the lower elevations and is usually adjacent to tidal creeks and pools. Needlerush dominates the slightly less frequently inundated zone. Vegetation at the higher elevations forms transitional areas to uplands and may contain species such as marsh-hay, glassworts, saltwort, saltgrass, sea ox-eye daises, marsh-elder, and saltbush as well as many other species. \n\nThe salt marsh habitat is among the most productive communities in the world.

    "description": "A coral reef is an epibenthic community; a concentrated topographic complex of massive corals and other sessile organisms (algae, bryozoans) that build calcium carbonate (limestone) skeletons. The structural complexity provides habitat for a highly diverse flora and fauna that live all or portions of their lives on coral reefs.  Two major Coral Reef types are recognized: patch reefs and offshore bank reefs. \n\nBank Reefs are further defined by zones (e.g., reef flat, spur and groove). The types of coral reefs found off the coast of Florida include the shallow-wave resistant reefs in the region from Dry Tortugas to Martin County; deeper (30-130 ft.; 10-40 m) reefs in the same region; the Oculina Banks seaward of Palm Beach to Vero Beach. Deep water (165-265 ft.; 50-80 m) structures such as Pulley Ridge and the Florida Middle Grounds occur along the west Florida shelf break in federal waters.  \n\nHard Bottom is characterized as mixed communities of algae, sponges, octocorals and stony corals. This habitat occurs in subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal zones throughout Florida's coastal waters. Hard Bottom is composed of attendant epibenthic biota on a rocky substrate composed of coquina, limestone, or relic coral, molluscan, and annelid reefs. Coquina is a limestone composed of broken shell debris. Limestone rock (many different strata) occurs as high- or low-relief outcrops of calcium carbonate. \n\nRelic reefs are the skeletal remains of once-living reefs such as the Vermetid Reef built by worm-like gastropod mollusks, Petaloconchus. These reefs are only known to be found in shallow waters seaward of the outer islands in the Ten Thousand Islands area of southwest Florida.\n\nHard bottom biological communities are structured by depth and latitude and inhabited by sessile, planktonic, epifaunal, and pelagic plants and animals; infaunal organisms are present in interstitial soft bottom substrate. In the region south of Stuart on the east coast of Florida and Bay Port on the west coast, subtidal hard bottom communities are characteristically inhabited by soft corals (octocorals) and sponges. Octocoral beds have dense concentrations of sea fans, sea plumes, and sea feathers. Mobile species found in octocoral beds include flamingo tongue shell, purple shrimp, and basket starfish. \n\nSponge beds include the branching, vase, tube, Florida loggerhead, and sheepswool sponges. Other mobile fauna found in both the octocoral beds and the sponge beds include amphipods, isopods, burrowing shrimp, crabs, sand dollars, and many species of fish. Although the coral species found in Hard Bottom habitat are not reef-building, they do contribute to the three-dimensional nature of the areas by increasing the surface area for sessile organisms and by providing important refuges for a variety of fish and invertebrates.",

Ocean acidification and temperature increases may lead to shifts from coral dominated reefs to  reefs dominated by algae or sponges.  Increased ocean acidity will reduce calcification and compromise skeletal structure of coral reefs.   \n\nIncreased precipitation will lead to increased runoff, impacting water quality by increasing nutrients, pollutants, and turbidity. It can take years for coral reefs to recover from damage incurred by storms and increasing storm frequency will reduce the odds of recovery between disturbance events.",

Increased water temperature and nutrient enrichment together promote hypoxia and harmful algal blooms.

The sea squirt and mollusks attach larvae and eggs to the seagrass leaves, while other juvenile fish and invertebrates use the seagrass beds as refugia, concealing themselves from predators.  \n\nThe loss of seagrass beds will further exacerbate degraded water quality due to the loss of the substrate stabilizing function seagrass provides.
